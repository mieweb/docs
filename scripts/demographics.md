Welcome to the Demographics Chart Tab\!

In this video, I’ll provide a high-level overview of the Demographics tab, including how to navigate to the tab, what information is displayed, how to update patient details, manage insurance, and handle duplicate charts.

**Chapter 1: What is the Demographics Tab?**

The Demographics tab is your central location for viewing and managing a patient’s core information. This includes personal details, contact information, employment and insurance data, and more. Keeping this information accurate is essential for patient safety, billing, and communication.

**Chapter 2: Navigating to the Demographics Tab**

To access the Demographics tab, search for the patient’s chart from the E-Chart sidemenu. Once in the chart, click on the Admin tab, then select Demographics from the available subtabs. The Demographics header, which appears in dark grey, will display key patient details such as name, chart status, age, date of birth, sex, home phone, next appointment, and medical record number. You’ll also see counters for tasks, open encounters, due items, order requisitions, and eSigns related to the patient. If a preferred name is entered, it will appear in parentheses next to the legal name.

**Chapter 3: Understanding the Demographics Header**

The demographics header is visible on all chart tabs, not just Demographics. Depending on your My Settings preferences, you may also see allergies, current medications, and current conditions displayed here. Any alerts entered into the chart will appear in red below the header, ensuring critical information is always visible.

**Chapter 4: Viewing and Editing Demographic Information**

Below the header, you’ll find sections for demographic, employment, marital/contact, and other data. Each section can be quickly edited by clicking the pencil icon in the top right corner of the section. If you have the appropriate security permissions, this allows you to update patient information directly from the Demographics tab. The patient’s photo is also displayed here for identification, and you can add or retake a photo as needed.

**Chapter 5: Employment, Marital, and Contact Information**

The Demographics tab includes sections for employment information, such as employer name, address, supervisor, job code, and work location. The Marital/Contact Information section includes marital status, spouse details, and emergency contacts, ensuring you have a complete picture of the patient’s background and support network.

**Chapter 6: Contacts and Relationships**

The Contacts/Relationships section is especially powerful. Here, you can view and assign user relationships, such as supervisors, case managers, and portal users. You’ll also see chart relationships, like provider organizations and employer groups, as well as interface pharmacy information. This section helps you track key connections and roles related to the patient, supporting both clinical care and organizational needs.

**Chapter 7: Other Data and Chart Types**

The Other Data section allows you to capture additional information, such as birth sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, personal pronouns, and previous names. This section can be customized to fit your organization’s needs. You can also manage chart types and employee numbers from this tab, including adding new partitions or updating chart type as needed.

**Chapter 8: Managing Insurance Information**

The Insurance Summary section at the bottom of the Demographics tab displays all current insurance policies for the patient. Here, you can add, edit, or inactivate insurance policies, as well as scan and link insurance card images. Access to these features is based on your security permissions. You can also view pre-certification details and manage insurance card images directly from this section.

**Chapter 9: Handling Duplicate Charts**

If the system detects possible duplicate charts based on matching demographics, you’ll see a list of potential matches at the bottom of the Demographics tab. You can review and merge duplicate charts if you have the necessary permissions. For most users, it’s enough to know that this feature helps keep patient records accurate and up to date.

**Chapter 10: Additional Tips**

Temporary or inactive records are clearly marked in the demographics header. If you need to merge charts or manage insurance, make sure you have the appropriate security permissions. For more detailed instructions, refer to the help documentation or reach out to your administrative superuser.

The Demographics tab is designed to make managing patient information simple and efficient. For more detailed instructions, you can find links to additional documentation and videos below this video, or search for “Demographics” in the help search bar for step-by-step guides and support.
