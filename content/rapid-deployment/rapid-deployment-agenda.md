Our Rapid Deployment Agenda provides clients with an outline of the high-level expectations and milestones of a successful deployment. The contents of this outline are based on the more-detailed [standard project plan](rapid-deployment-project-outline.md). For a look at the potential timeline, time estimates, and agenda topics, be sure to check out the [Project Kick-Off](rapid-deployment-agenda/project-kick-off-meeting.md), the [Core Team Demonstration](rapid-deployment-agenda/high-level-demonstration-for-core-team.md), and the various [Deployment Meetings](rapid-deployment-agenda/deployment-planning.md). Note that many of the objectives and milestones can be executed concurrently, utilizing all available resources more effectively and efficiently, thus shortening deployment times.
