## Overview

As a means to streamline applicant engagement and tracking, as well as offer easy access to request an appointment, complete questionnaires, upload immunization information, complete consent forms, and upload documentation, {{% system-name %}} offers its certified applicant portal. The {{% system-name %}} web-based applicant portal is available 24/7 and provides secure access for candidates to use when and where it is most convenient for them. The applicant portal is designed to prompt engagement with user-friendly, intuitive pre-placement questionnaires, with responses being captured electronically, automatically populating the appropriate fields and documents within the clinical application, thus minimizing data entry and management for clinic staff. Applicant records may be automatically purged from the system after a predetermined amount of time if they are not hired. Additionally, the supervisor portal provides an HR and manager dashboard to view applicant work status reports, which include employee surveillance status and restrictions/accommodations. The time savings is significant – no more endless phone calls to collect information or to schedule appointments.

New hires may be manually registered into a separate applicant (APP) medical record partition either on the clinical side or using an applicant portal. The pre-placement health surveillance panel tracks appropriate testing that is required based on the job role. If the employee is hired their temporary medical record may be merged to their permanent medical record automatically using a scheduled job or manually using the document queue merge tool. Custom configuration is required to add electronic pre-placement questionnaires, health surveillance panels, email templates, and automated business rules.

Standard functionality for the pre-placement workflow includes:
* Client-specific branding with logo
* Applicant portal
* Applicant (APP) partition
* Pre-placement questionnaire
* Appointment scheduling requests/tasking
* Appointment invitation, confirmation, and reminder emails
* Pre-placement visit encounter
* Quick View Pre-placement worklist
* Health surveillance pre-placement panel
* Document queue tool available for customer to merge duplicate records 
* Purge editor is available for customer use to purge documents for applicants that aren't hired after a predetermined time

## Pre Placement Workflow Demonstration


1. HR directs applicant to the applicant portal
2. Applicant completes a mini registration and fills out consents, questionnaire(s) needed, and uploads documentation on the applicant portal and prints completed questionnaires
    1. Pre-Placement (APP) partition chart is created in EH after they visit the applicant portal

        1. or manually register a chart if applicant hasn't visited the portal prior to calling to schedule appt
    2. Merge all charts if applicable (if the applicant went and did multiple charts from portal) via the ‘Manual Merge' portlet found in Summary chart tab
        1. Currently only a handful of users have merge rights.  Use the fast task ‘Merge Chart Request' to send a task to Admin dept to merge duplicate charts if needed
    3. While in demographics, checkmark ‘Is Applicant' which marks chart as ‘temporary chart'
    4. Due List portlet: Add applicant to "PrePlacement Entry" surveillance program (hint: search in the order field for <strong>entry</strong>) and ‘evaluate' to trigger for what needs done during the exam
        1. Add any add-on testing programs needing done (ex: DOT, Crane, Hazmat, Hawoper, Vision, etc), but <em>DO NOT Put an Applicant/Preplacement in any entry with membership programs - make sure is just ‘entry' only.</em>
        2. After evaluating the PrePlacement Entry program (and any add-on programs needed) on their due list, a waitlist appointment is created.
    5. Create/schedule appointment for preplacement exam by going to Appointments portlet in Summary dashboard and clicking Appointment Needs Scheduled hyperlink next to the Preplacement waitlist appt displayed there.
        1. Send an Apt Confirmation when scheduling appt in the Add Appt Screen
4. Applicant arrives at Clinic for scheduled appointment
    1. Applicant visits the Front Desk, returns completed paperwork
    2. Front Desk Staff Check-in Applicant for scheduled appointment

    ## Applicable Reports


    ## System Configuration

    To more fully address preferred configurations and review available options and features, utilize the [Provider Management sidemenu](https://system/?f=layout&module=MASTER&name=EPM_Maintenance&tabmodule=+) to access and edit the employee and supervisor portals. These configurations will be visible from the respective portal when accessed. To begin the initial setup and finalize configuring of the portal(s), there is additional information that is important to understand before getting started. Review the following, and work with the Deployment Consultant to ensure the portal(s) configurations are suited to the business needs.


    * <strong>Applicant partition</strong>
    * <strong>Applicant portal setup</strong>
    * <strong>Task rule and department setup</strong>
    * <strong>Consent and questionnaire flowsheets</strong>
    * <strong>Schedule job - auto-merging</strong>


### Portal Setup

When configuring the web-based portal(s) for the first time, it is best to navigate to the [Portal Setup tab](https://system/?f=chart&s=pat&t=Portal+Setup&v=dashboard&pat_id=41) of the Portal Provider Organization. This tab contains options for first-time setup and some standard configurations. These options are designed to allow portals to be preliminarily customized and accessed according to the business needs.
To begin using the **First Time Setup**, click the section header to expand and display the options. Once opened, security roles may be selected to indicate which roles have access to the portal.
{{% info %}}

By default, any {{% system-name %}} user with the necessary user-patient relationships established can access the portal. This means that as long as the user-patient relationship is set correctly, the portal will be enabled for all security roles.
{{% /info %}}
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000002E0000001EF12720DA96B226995.png)
The **Portal** section, on the other hand, includes options to make label and verbiage changes, to update the logo, to disable either the employee or supervisor portal, and to add a consent form that would need to be electronically signed before being granted access to the portal.

Some of the options needing customized or addressed, include:
* <strong>Replacement text for Enterprise Health</strong>: This field is used to replace the <em>Enterprise Health</em> label with the provided text. The replacement text should be the business name.
* <strong>Logo - Upload new logo</strong>: Click the <em>Upload new logo</em> link to replace the default logo. The page will refresh after confirming the image selection.
* <strong>Consent forms needing completed</strong>: Click the <em>Add consent forms</em> link to add forms. This will determine which consent form(s) a user will be required to complete prior to being granted portal access. Users will not have portal access until all required forms are completed.
{{% info %}}

An order for the consent must be added to the Portal Consent picklist, with an associated questionnaire flowsheet linked to the order for the verbiage.
{{% /info %}}
* <strong>Renewal interval</strong>: This determines the interval at which consent forms need completed. If no interval is provided, each form will only be required once. Setting the renewal interval to the shortest requirement is recommended.
All other options are part of the standard configuration and are enabled by default. No additional changes are required in this section, unless more customizations are needed to suit the business needs. In these cases, users are welcome to review the [Patient Portal](../../functions/portal-management/patient-portal-first-time-setup-and-configuration.md) online help documentation, for further details.

### Applicant Portal

The applicant portal is a web-based platform available for screening new employees and streamlining the hiring process. The applicant portal is an optional module designed as a login terminal for increased usability. With it, employers have the ability to simplify the onboarding process and ensure all pre-employment needs are addressed early and accurately.
This portal is configured so that candidates can be directed to the portal to complete forms and/or questionnaires, according to the hiring and pre-employment needs of the business. Candidates simply need to begin the portal session by entering their first and last name. Once the applicant has completed the forms/questionnaires, all of the information is submitted to the employer electronically. From here, a login-disabled user account will be drafted and linked to the pre-configured Applicant department, so if hired, the information can be easily merged into the employee user account.
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000002EB00000172C0ED59A4F96E5894.png)

#### System Configuration and Setup

Be sure to speak with a Deployment Consultant if there is interest in maintaining an applicant portal, so any preferred configurations can be fully addressed and all available options and features can be reviewed. Once the portal has been configured, the URL will be made available for marketing purposes. From the Provider Management sidemenu, however, permitted users will have the ability to edit the title, color scheme, available questionnaires, and instructions. These configurations will then be visible within the portal accessed by the candidates.
**Questionnaire(s) for Applicants**: Clients will determine what types of information and number of forms/questionnaires applicants will be expected to complete. Discussions with the Deployment Consultant will help establish the necessary configurations and workflow (e.g., link necessary questionnaire(s) to corresponding order items; indicate what document type each questionnaire will be saved as; confirm the preferred chart tab to which each document type will be mapped).
**Questionnaire(s) Data Fields**: Additional discussions will be needed to determine what specific information is necessary from each questionnaire being presented to applicants, as well as in what way the information will be recorded. The Deployment Consultant will assist with configuring observations and observation flowsheets, to align with the appropriate free text data fields and pre-templated options needed on each questionnaire.
**Order Picklist**: Any questionnaires being used for the applicant portal must fall within an order picklist. Work with the Deployment Consultant to ensure an Applicant Portal order picklist is configured, listing each questionnaire needed for an Employer Organization (EO) or Provider Organization (PO) applicant portal.
**Applicant Portal EO or PO Chart Tab**: Customizations to the applicant portal can be done through the Applicant Portal chart tab of the EO or PO, as needed. It is through the Applicant Portal chart tab that users with the necessary permissions may configure the portal components. The portal URL suffix will be provided from this tab, which will be appended to the production database base URL and distributed for use.
**Tasking**: It is important to discuss and determine any tasklist events needing triggered whenever applicants register and submit information via the applicant portal.
**Merging**: Once an applicant is hired, it is important to merge the applicant chart with the employee chart. New employee charts are typically generated through the HR interface feed. Determine the workflow for merging charts, and ensure users who will be working applicant charts have the necessary merge security permissions.

### System Settings

In {{% system-name %}} systems, workflows *use charts* for every patient, as well as users, employees, staff, etc. {{% system-name %}} may already be set up to create a user when a chart is registered manually, or via an HR interface, by way of the *Enable PUR Routine* system setting. Correct relationships are then needed between charts and users for portal functionality to work for those users.

## Visit Workflow


#### HR directs applicant to applicant portal

HR will embed the applicant portal url into their email communications to the applicant and instruct the applicant as to which questionnaires need submitted by the specific applicant.

#### Applicant fills out questionnaire(s) needed

Applicant will visit the business applicant portal to key in their name, DOB and SSN then proceeding to fill out the specific questionnaire(s) HR indicated in their communications. When the applicant submits questionnaires via the applicant portal, a pre-placement partitioned chart is created in EH. Applicant should also print their submitted/completed questionnaires from their portal session.

#### Manually Provision Chart by Clinicians if applicant didn't visit the applicant portal

There may be an instance where an applicant does not visit the applicant portal prior to calling to make their appointment.  You can direct them to follow the directions to visit the applicant portal first and then call back to schedule the appointment.  If they refuse, you can manually create the chart in Enterprise Health. First search charts in EH to make sure a chart doesn't already exist for the individual.  If a chart doesn't exist, the staff can manually create the preplacement/applicant chart
* To create a new chart go to e-chart sidemenu tab then click Patient Registration
* Insert their name, DOB and search for the word <em>pre</em> in the organization field and select (from the auto-complete) <strong>Applicant/PrePlacement</strong> organization to relate the chart to. 
    * This is what puts the chart in the specific partition of preplacement.
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/100002010000057300000169C03F3D7ADDDFFD85.png)
* Click the ADD NEW button
* The chart is created into the PRE partition and you will be taken to the edit demographics screen to continue keying in demographic information for this preplacement applicant.  You will see the PRE chart medical record # assigned in the top right corner.
    * Only information on the left side of the demographics screen needs filled out.  The right side is for employee specific chart information when they are hired.  
    * Make sure to checkmark <em>Is Applicant </em>on the left side
        * Checkmarking <em>Is Applicant </em>flags the chart as temporary, which is needed for auto-chart merging rules that happen in the background for when/if the applicant is hired
    * Click the SAVE button
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000003C3000003350A63331CB27617DC.png)

**Wake - Applicant Pre-Hire Front Desk Workflow**
***Make sure your Default Location in My Settings is set to the clinic location you are working at each day***
***Very important that you have your default location set to the campus you are working at today, otherwise you will check people into the wrong location and staff will not have visibility to them***

# Search for existing chart

Go to E-Chart sidemenu tab and search for the person who is coming into the clinic to be seen for a Pre-Hire/Applicant/Post Offer evaluation at the Front Desk.  Your search default is by name, meaning to search you need to type in last name, then first name.  

Do your search as general or as granular as needed to get the results.  A wild card % is available in the search for last names.
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000006C9000001A75AD2BFE5482CA078.png)

# Existing/Matching Chart Found

HR/Talent team is to register charts into the Applicant organization and schedule their pre-hire appointment at an employee health site that is allowed to do pre-hire evals.  So the person's chart should be in Enterprise Health when you go to search.  If the chart is not, you can manually register a chart into the Applicant organization in steps further down in this guide.
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/100002010000065B000001E78F91976412E8D919.png)
If the person has never been an employee at Wake before, their chart should be found in the Applicant MR# partition.  If they were an employee of Wake before, their chart may be found as Agility or Employee_ID partition because they were an employee before, terminated and perhaps are now being rehired.  We want to make sure to only have one chart per person and the ‘partition' or MR# prefix that the chart has depends on things such as brand new to Wake, or they've worked here before and left, etc.

## Pre-Hire Applicant Chart Found

If an existing chart has any scheduled appointments for it, you will see that information from the Summary chart tab.  You will see in the dark grey header bar at the top any *Next Appointments*.  You will also see an **Appointments** portlet on the Summary tab that lists any upcoming appointment information.  This can help you to visually notice if their visit to the clinic today is for a scheduled need or is a walk-in.
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/100002010000069F00000315C2E4299B2F4AF266.png)

# Checkin Applicant

It is important to check the chart into the Waiting Room so that the timer starts and the worklists reflect who is in the clinic physically. Using the **Checkin** link will do that for you.  When in the chart, find the **Checkin** link above under the dark grey patient header bar, or in the Quick Links-EH portlet where quick accessibility to functions is.
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000006A10000024FD338DD7E4A5D896A.png)
Click **Checkin** link
The system will look to see if any scheduled appointments for today exist for the chart.

## Check Applicant Chart into Waiting Room for Scheduled Pre-Hire Appointment

If the system finds any existing scheduled appointments for today's date (the date you are signifying to check them in), it will display a screen such as this:
* <img src="review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000006C100000120CF0D72DB16D3EC3C.png" />
The screen tells you to click the hyperlink for the found pre-hire appointment date/time if you are checking them in for that appointment.  **It is important to click the appointment hyperlink there to link the checkin to their scheduled appointment if they are indeed being seen for that scheduled appointment**.  Click the hyperlink that lists their found appointment.
**	Note:** You would only click the box *checkin with new encounter* infrequently.  Such as if the person were not being seen/being checked in for their specific scheduled appointment (ex: It's 9am and they are coming in for a work injury/exposure, but later on in the day at 2pm they have a scheduled appointment for a Respirator Fit test).  You would not check them in for that scheduled Resp Fit test because their visit is for an injury, so you would not click the appointment hyperlink on this screen (to link the checkin to this scheduled appt) because you are not checking them in for that appointment, you are seeing them for a walk-in reason that isn't affiliated with the Resp Fit scheduled appointment they have later that day.

The system will display the Checkin screen to you.  You only need to do 2 things here because the system will do the rest for you:
1. Make sure the <strong>Station</strong> at the very bottom says ‘Waiting Room'
    1. If it does not, select that drop-down, but you should be defaulted to that station
2. Click the SAVE button to save the chart to station ‘Waiting Room'
**Note:** you will see the appointment information on this screen since you indicated to check them in linked to the found appointment, and you will also see the HR/Talent Team scheduling notes in the Notes/Comments field.
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000006AA0000031B5A2FEF4BA39C084F.png)
The system has now checked them into the Waiting Room and started the time tracking.
Your screen will show them as checked into the Waiting Room for the specific clinic/campus location you have set in your My Settings default location preference. ***Very important that you have your default location already set to the campus you are working at today, otherwise you have checked them into the wrong location***

Get back into the person's chart by clicking on their name at the very top left corner in the dark-grey bar.  You need to finish up the demographics for the Pre-Hire Applicant chart and get them *Ready for Clinician* next.
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000006A8000002DF5E1B340D438B68F5.png)
Back in the chart, you will land on the Summary chart tab.  You will see that the system added & created the appropriate open encounter for the specific pre-hire appointment reason you linked their Checkin to in previous steps.  You will see that open encounter in the **Open Encounters** portlet on the Summary tab.
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/100002010000069A0000027AE04A20971286934C.png)

## Update Demographics for Checked-In Applicant Chart & Flag as Temporary

When in the Summary chart tab, you will see no demographics besides the name & DOB for the applicant/pre-hire. HR/Talent Team does not have security to demographics so they can only key in name & DOB when registering the chart into the system.  When they come in for their pre-hire eval, you need to update their demographics.  Click on the pencil icon in the Demographics portlet to get to the **Edit Demographics** screen.
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000005E500000183662D094E73D0A618.png)
Once in **Edit Demographics** screen for the Applicant chart, you will work the left side.  
**Note:** you can update demographics for Applicant MR# charts because demographics info will stay there until they get hired, which then puts them into Peoplesoft which then feeds into Enterprise Health and merges the charts.

On the left side demographic fields, key in their address, cell, and any other important info.  The right side fields are what Peoplesoft will send in once hired.
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000005B60000033C41AF4C135999A1EC.png)
The last important step in the Applicant's chart is to checkmark the **Is Applicant** box.  ****Only do this if the chart you are in is set to Applicant Medical Record (MR) #.  If the top right corner Medical Record number says ‘Applicant' then make sure to checkmark ‘Is Applicant'**.  

If the chart you are in says Employee_ID at the top right corner for medical record number or Agility, please do not checkmark ‘is applicant' checkbox because that means the person has worked here before and had a chart come over from Peoplesoft and/or Agility and they are not new to the company.
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000006C6000002AF6773D600A292BD1D.png)
Once done with demographics and checkmarking Is Applicant if the chart is in the Applicant MR# partition, then click the **Save** button to save your work.
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/100002010000069A0000033296066137C2BDD0D8.png)
The reason to checkmark ‘Is Applicant' in an Applicant partitioned chart, it will mark the chart as ‘temporary' in a red banner and once they are hired, the system will link any matching ‘temporary' flagged Applicant chart into their Peoplesoft Employee_ID chart that will come in once hired.  Thus eliminates duplicate charts and having to manually merge later on when a duplicate is found.
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000006BF000003488DE7A06834A82FB6.png)

## Move Applicant Chart to ‘Ready for Clinician' station

You will also see that the chart is still in the checkin station named **Waiting Room**. You will see this at the left up under the dark grey patient header bar of the Applicant's chart.  Because you've already checked them into the Waiting Room and linked the checkin to their scheduled appointment, then have updated their demographics and marked ‘Is Applicant'.  So now you are ready to set the station to ‘Ready for Clinician'.
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000006AD00000336A71E110D16289318.png)

You now need to move the chart out of the Waiting Room station to be ‘Ready for Clinician' station so that the clinicians know a person/chart is ready to be taken back and for what visit reason.

Click on the station (while still in the chart) that currently says **Waiting Room (x)** from either the top left under the dark grey patient header bar.  You are now going to change the station from ‘Waiting Room' to be now ‘Ready for Clinician' when you are done with your front desk activities for the chart (ex: done making copies of historical injection records they bring in, or copying their drivers license, etc)

When you click on the **Waiting Room (x)** link, it will pop-up a small box to Enter New Station Details.
1. Set <strong>New Station</strong> field (using the drop-down) to be <strong>Ready for Clinician</strong>
2. In the <strong>Comment</strong> field will be the HR/Talent Team notes. Keep those, but type in PRE-HIRE at the bottom of it.
3. Click <strong>Save</strong> button to save your work. 
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000006C0000001B14496398EA33778EE.png)
Go work the next person to checkin by getting out of this chart by clicking E-Chart sidemenu tab, etc.

# Chart Registration/Checkin for Pre-Hire WalkIn who was not registered or scheduled by HR/Talent Team


## Applicant Chart Registration

There may be one-off chances that someone comes in for a pre-hire that isn't in the system nor has as scheduled Pre-Hire appointment.  HR/Talent team is to register everyone and schedule them, but there could be a need for the front desk staff to have to do the Applicant chart creation.

If you cannot find the Applicant's existing chart in the system at all, go to E-Chart on the sidemenu tab and at the very top tabs click **Patient Registration**.** ** Only can register Applicant charts into Enterprise Health. Employees would already have an existing chart in Enterprise Health from Peoplesoft.
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000005CA00000183B593C5998F87547C.png)
The mini-registration screen appears:
**Last Name:**  This is required - key in last name of Applicant
**First Name:**This is required - key in first name of Applicant
**Date of Birth:**This is required - must key in a date of birth (if they refuse, then just type in some default convention ilke 1/1/1900 so that signifies to staff they refused)
**Organization:** Must type in **Applicant** and select the Applicant choice from the auto-complete.  *Do not select anything else in the Organization auto-complete.  You* **_must_*** search/select Applicant as the organization.*
Click **ADD NEW** button to continue

Once in **Demographic Information** screen for the Applicant chart, you will work the left side.  
**Note:** you can key in demographics for Applicant MR# charts because demographics info will stay there until they get hired, which then puts them into Peoplesoft which then feeds into Enterprise Health and merges the charts.

On the left side demographic fields, key in their address, cell, and any other important info.  The right side fields are what Peoplesoft will send in once hired.
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000005B60000033C41AF4C135999A1EC.png)
The last important step in the Applicant's chart is to checkmark the **Is Applicant** box.  ****Only do this if the chart you are in is set to Applicant Medical Record (MR) # (which should be since you registered the chart to that organization).   If the top right corner Medical Record number says ‘Applicant' then make sure to checkmark ‘Is Applicant'**.  
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000006C6000002AF6773D600A292BD1D.png)
Once done with demographics and checkmarking Is Applicant if the chart is in the Applicant MR# partition, then click the **Save** button to save your work.
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/100002010000069A0000033296066137C2BDD0D8.png)
The reason to checkmark ‘Is Applicant' in an Applicant partitioned chart, it will mark the chart as ‘temporary' in a red banner and once they are hired, the system will link any matching ‘temporary' flagged Applicant chart into their Peoplesoft Employee_ID chart that will come in once hired.  Thus eliminates duplicate charts and having to manually merge later on when a duplicate is found.

You will see the **Checkin** hyperlink available at the top left under the dark grey patient header bar.  Click on that **Checkin** hyperlink.
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000006B9000002134BBDE21BFCC33132.png)
In the system (after clicking the Checkin hyperlink in steps above) you will see the Checkin screen and no option to checkin for any scheduled appointments, because this is a newly registered Applicant chart which doesn't have any appointments scheduled to it.   You only need to do 2 things here:
1. Make sure the <strong>Station</strong> at the very bottom says ‘Waiting Room'
    1. If it does not, select that drop-down, but you should be defaulted to that station
      2) Click the SAVE button to save the chart to station ‘Waiting Room'
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000006BF000003226C5884C1E060F37F.png)
The system has now checked them into the Waiting Room and started the time tracking.
Your screen will show them as checked into the Waiting Room for the specific clinic/campus location you have set in your My Settings default location preference.  ***Very important that you have your default location already set to the campus you are working at today, otherwise you have checked them into the wrong location***

Get back into the person's chart by clicking on their name at the very top left corner in the dark-grey bar.  You need to finish up and get them *Ready for Clinician* next.
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000006B20000021FC6D071181385C413.png)
Back in the Applicant chart, you will land on the Summary chart tab.  Since the applicant wasn't in the system so obviously didn't have any scheduled appointment, the system has no idea what they are here for.  So you (the front desk staff) need to add & create an encounter for the clinicians/providers to document in.  You can verify this by seeing the **Open Encounters** portlet on the Summary tab.  There should be no open encounters in that portlet (because encounters should get closed & archived daily).
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000006BC000002615FAEAA682A20948F.png)
Go to the portlet **Quick Links-EH** and click on the hyperlink **EH-Post Offer Eval****** encounter to create for their visit through the clinic. 
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000006BC000002618FC8703FC66D5129.png)
Once the Post Offer Eval encounter is selected from the Quick Links -EH portlet, the system will add and create the Post Offer Eval encounter.  You will be taken into the new created/open encounter where you can do 2 things:

Verify the correct encounter visit type & Archive As fields are appropriate according to what you selected.
**Note:** If not, simply expand the Encounter Info section by clicking anywhere on the grey title bar ‘Encounter Info' and change those fields if needed
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000006B20000025D7107BACB3B8DC685.png)
You will also see that the Applicant chart is in the checkin station named **Waiting Room**. You will see this at the top of the new open encounter you created for the chart.
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000006B20000025D1BE97EAC40DC59D5.png)
You now need to move the chart out of the Waiting Room station to be ‘Ready for Clinician' station so that the clinicians know a person/chart is ready to be taken back and for what visit reason.

Click on the station hyperlink that currently says **Waiting Room (x)** at the top of the Post Offer Eval encounter you created.  You are now going to change the station from ‘Waiting Room' to be now ‘Ready for Clinician' when you are done with your front desk activities for the chart (ex: done making copies of historical injection records they bring in, or copying their drivers license, etc)

When you click on the **Waiting Room (x)** link, it will pop-up a small box to Enter New Station Details.
1. Set <strong>New Station</strong> field (using the drop-down) to be <strong>Ready for Clinician</strong>
2. Type in the <strong>Comment</strong> field (using freetext) PRE-HIRE.  This allows the clinicians elsewhere in the clinic to see which person to call back easily so they know what they are here for.
3. Click <strong>Save</strong> button to save your work. 
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000006A90000020323CDBFDC7A1E4F4D.png)
Go work the next person to checkin by getting out of this chart by clicking E-Chart sidemenu tab, etc.

## Screenshots


## PrePlacement/Candidate/Applicant


### Manually Create Applicant Chart (if not using HR portal nor Applicant portal)

Manually create a chart in EH for the applicant until HR portal is being used and/or Applicant Portal
From E-Chart, use the Patient Registration tab.

From the patient registration screen, key in the required fields of Last and First name, Date of Birth and for Organization, search for **_Cargill_** as the key organization word and select the specific clinic location grouped applicant organization.  *Note: you can start typing in Cargill or Applicant and will see the choice to select.*
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000005A8000001FFD153D9C827AFEF7B.png)

Once you've created the applicant chart manually in the EH system, while still in the edit demographics screen, make sure to ✔ checkmark the **_Is Applicant_** box towards the bottom left.  This flags the chart with a red banner at the top that indicates to the system that it is a *temporary record. * This flag helps the system automatically merge applicant chart(s) to their permanently hired employee chart when the HR system sends that in.
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000006D400000363BAC3D764CA34563D.png)

### Applicant/Candidate/PrePlacement Arrives for Scheduled Appointment

Navigate to search and find the specific Applicant's chart via E-Chart search and verify it is the correct chart.  Update any demographic fields as needed such as address, phone, gender, etc.

On the Summary dashboard tab of the applicant's chart, click the pencil icon (manage info) on Demographics portlet to get to edit demographics screen
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000006CA000001FD420A18DFCFCC72F5.png)

Edit demographics to collect information (phone/address/gender etc) and make sure the checkmark for *Is Applicant* is marked towards the bottom left of the screen.  The checkmarked box named *Is Applicant* flags the chart as a temporary record, which is needed for auto-chart merging rules that happen in the background for the system to auto merge to their permanent employee chart for when/if the applicant is hired.


#### Applicant fills out questionnaire(s) needed

Applicants need to fill out the applicable questionnaires (for the job being considered for) using Cargill Protein's Applicant Portal.  Note: the applicant portal is only English supported. When the applicant submits questionnaires via the applicant portal, another separate Applicant partitioned chart (according to clinic location) is created in EH.

There may be an instance where an applicant does not go to the applicant portal to fill out the questionnaire(s) needed.  If they refuse or cannot, you can print off paper form versions of the questionnaires and scan/index in, or you can in real-time do the questionnaire when working in the exam encounter and complete together within the encounter using electronic format.

Enterprise Health will alert you of any possible duplicate charts matching name, DOB, and/or SSN if applicable.  View the **Manual Merge** portlet from the Summary dashboard to Merge any duplicate charts if the applicant went on the applicant portal multiple times.  **_Note: _**Currently only a handful of users have merge rights.  Use the Add Task method to submit a fast task ‘Merge Chart Request' to send a task to Health Service Managers department who can merge duplicate charts if needed
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/100002010000068D00000249053800AB8FE6D288.png)

Clinicians can **_move_** questionnaires from the applicant's other chart, to be in the applicant chart that has the appointment information (from HR request) though, so that information can be in the chart when the exam is performed.



### PrePlacement Exam Visit Encounter

Clinicians will need to manually create and generate a *PrePlacement Exam* encounter.  Do this by going to the Quick Links portlet and clicking the Add PrePlacement Exam hyperlink.
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000006BA00000264F558B10DC1AAFE90.png)
The PrePlacement Exam encounter is now created and will take you directly into the encounter to begin documenting.

### Stages

The PrePlacement encounter may need to remain ‘open' and in some sort of ‘stage' to indicate to users why it is still open, what you are still waiting on, etc.
Stage buttons are available at the top right portion of the encounter (or at the bottom of the encounter).  When the PrePlacement encounter cannot be closed & archived yet (because there is a need for other information or other needs) and cannot perform the written opinion-PrePlacement yet, utilize the Stage buttons.
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000006CC000001DA7E842DEFA04FBE64.png)
Keep the PrePlacement encounter open and manage via the PrePlacement Exam Worklist (found in Quick View sidemenu tab).

#### PrePlacement Exam Worklist

From the Quick View sidemenu tab, a portlet is available named **Pre-Placement Exam Worklist**.  This lists any PrePlacement Exam encounters that are still **open** status (not archived & closed) and what *Stage* they are in (if applicable due to results or info still pending before a written opinion-PrePlacement can be completed).

Use this worklist to manage and follow up getting the PrePlacement Exam encounters to archived & closed status after the Written Opinion-PrePlacement has been completed.

### Perform Written Opinion(s) in Recommendations Encounter Section

Once the PrePlacement Drug Screen results are in, back on this PrePlacement Exam encounter, the **Recommendations** encounter section contains the written opinion for PrePlacement.   You will use this section to document a written opinion Preplacement to signify if and what they are cleared for.   This is the overall PrePlacement clearance.  

Once this written opinion is performed, that written opinion PrePlacement document will automatically be tasked to the appropriate health services location Clinicians team.  The clinicians will grab the task and manually email the Written Opinion-PrePlacement document to the appropriate HR Rep. 
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000006A00000017E97AEB89D6F5048AF.png)

### Health Service Manager E-Signs Completed Encounter Document

If the encounter is archived and closed by a staff member,  this will trigger an automated task to notify the HSM department to review and E-Sign the completed full PrePlacement encounter document and mark that task done. 




## Report

There is a report available to list applicant partitioned charts that do not have the **_Is Applicant_** checkbox marked.  Which then indicates the chart is not flagged as temporary and wouldn't be able to be merged with a permanent employee record once they are hired.
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000004E7000001C6C9284AD889B7EB13.png)
Clicking on that report will list any applicant partitioned charts without the *Is Applicant* box being checked in their chart. 
![](review-session-pre-placement.assets/10000201000006B4000000EDE34F9A6CD3C86E1A.png)

 This is the opportunity to go into the listed chart(s) and fix that via edit demographics.

From the Quick View sidemenu tab, a portlet is available named **Pre-Placement Exam Worklist**.  This lists any PrePlacement Exam encounters that are still **open** status (not archived & closed) and what *Stage* they are in (if applicable due to drug screen results still pending before a written opinion-PrePlacement can be completed).

Use this worklist to manage and follow up getting the PrePlacement Exam encounters to archived & closed status after the Written Opinion-PrePlacement has been completed.
