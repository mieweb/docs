The following page provides details on the correct terminology for screens and items that appear in an MIE (WebChart, Enterprise Health) system.  
For an overview on basic {{% system-name %}} navigation and functionality, see [Intro to the System](../intro-to-the-system.md).
  
## Header and Side Navigation  
  
MIE system navigation is driven through a number of toolbars and menus accessible at the top and sides of the system.
  
### Header Toolbars  
  
Layered toolbars appear throughout the MIE system at the top of the page to provide navigation, patient details, and encounter details. The number of toolbars change depending on the page. Additionally, the toolbars collapse as you navigate some pages to maximize space for data entry.

When fully expanded, the toolbars appear from the very top of the MIE system as follows:  
A. Application toolbar: Displays application ( {{% system-name %}} ) navigation:
1. Show/hide menu icon: Shows or hides the left side menu tab.
2. Home icon: Opens the designated home page for the signed-in user (customized per user or department).
3. Department, task, and document links: Links open designated lists for tasks, documents, etc.
4. Subscription status icon: Chain links icon indicates whether or not the signed in user is connected to the database. This connection also displays messages to notify a user if another user is working in a document that is currently open.
5. Help bubble: Links to available help documentation.

B. Tab toolbar: Displays any tabs that pertain to the page that is currently open. Tabs in this toolbar are sometimes referred to as "chart tabs."  
C. Patient info toolbar: Displays patient name and MR # when working in an E-chart.
1. Side chart icon: Opens the side chart when working in an encounter. Displays pertinent patient information (demographics, notes, medical records, orders/tests, comments) on the right side of the page.

D. Patient Extended toolbar: Displays demographic, encounter, and other related information (such as incidents) while working in an E-chart or an encounter.  
E. Alerts toolbar: Displays available alert information for patient while working in an E-chart or encounter.  
F. Encounter info toolbar: Displays links to open encounters while working in an E-chart or encounter.  
G. Encounter navigation toolbar: Displays navigation tabs to skip to different sections while working in an encounter. Hover over the tabs to display the sections that appear under each category.  
H. Encounter links: Links related to an open encounter, as well as a number of tabs and buttons, including:
1. Staging tabs: Changes the stage of an open encounter and indicates that one user is finished with the encounter. The next user takes over in the new stage.
2. Release button: Notifies other users that the current user is no longer editing an encounter.
3. Save incomplete button: Saves current changes to the encounter but does not archive and close it.
4. Save incomplete and view button: Saves current changes to the encounter and opens a copy of the encounter to view in a final format.
5. Note complete button: Used for taking a note on a patient; saves and closes the note.
6. Archive and close button: Archives (finalizes) the encounter and closes it.

![](../system-anatomy.assets/3bff6b576461e7efe8c1c2e773ad538c.png)  

1. <strong>Left side menu</strong>: The navigational menu on the left side of the system. The left side menu is comprised of a number of customizable <strong>tabs</strong> The left side menu is accessed through the show/hide menu icon.
2. <strong>Side chart</strong>: The side chart displays information from a patient's chart. It is accessed only in an encounter by clicking the side chart icon.
3. <strong>Tabs</strong>: Tabs appear at the top of most pages. A tab is rounded, labeled, rectangular shape at the top of a page.
4. <strong>Subtabs</strong>: An extended tab that further organizes related information. Sub-tabs drop down from some tabs. A small, downward facing triangular shape at the corner of a tab indicates that subtabs are available.
5. <strong>Pop-out icon</strong>: A circular icon with an upward facing arrow is called a pop-out icon. This icon opens a new browser window or tab from the tab or sub-tab.
  
## Chart  
  
The following items can be seen throughout MIE systems. Here, a patient chart is used for identification.
  
![](../system-anatomy.assets/3b0ca617252aa223a71b3e76972b0b64.png)  

1. <strong>Quick link</strong>: Any underlined text (including text that displays an underline when the cursor hovers over it) that links to another page is identified as a link. The links on the left side of the header are identified as quick links.
2. <strong>Portlet</strong>: A movable customizable box that displays a summary of information or links is identified as a portlet. Portlets are displayed on the Quick View or on a patient's E-chart.
3. <strong>Icon</strong>: A small descriptive figure (such as those that appear on a portlet heading) is identified as an icon. Icons allow a user to perform an action or links to other information when clicked. This example displays portlet icons.
4. <strong>Link</strong>: Any underlined text (including text that displays an underline when the cursor hovers over it) that links to another page is identified as a link.
  
## Encounter  
  
The following items can be seen throughout MIE systems. Here, an encounter is used for identification.
  
![](../system-anatomy.assets/f4debfe97b8d63d668563d73dbb863a0.png)  

1. <strong>Section</strong>: A line of text that is obviously used to divide a longer page into distinct parts is identified as a section.
2. <strong>Button</strong>: A grey, labeled rectangle that enables the system to perform an action is identified as a button. Buttons are often squared and raised, but are sometimes smaller and rounded to fit in a smaller space.
3. <strong>Field</strong>: An empty, rectangular box that is populated with text is identified as a field.
4. <strong>Free text field</strong>: A field that allows the user to type in text as needed is referred to as a free text field. It is populated with text by typing into it and is not populated by any pre-written or selected text. These are often used for comments or notes.
5. <strong>Icon</strong>: A small descriptive figure (such as those that appear on a portlet heading) is identified as an icon. Icons allow a user to perform an action or links to other information when clicked. This example displays icons related to date selection.
6. <strong>Checkbox</strong>: A square box that displays a check mark or 'x' indicating that something (most often in a list) is selected is identified as a checkbox.
7. <strong>Autocomplete field</strong>: A field with a small triangle in the bottom right edge is identified as an autocomplete field. Autocomplete uses the text a user types to generate a number of options for them to select from.
8. <strong>Date Picker</strong>: A small icon that looks like a calendar and allows users to select a date is identified as a date picker.

3. <strong>Free text field</strong>: A field that allows the user to type in text as needed is referred to as a free text field. It is populated with text by typing into it and is not populated by any pre-written or selected text. These are often used for comments or notes. Expanding free text fields can expand to hold more text and are marked with two small downward facing diagonal lines inside of a square in the lower right corner of the field.
