Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning given in the Agreement.  Except as modified below, the terms of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

In consideration of the mutual obligations set forth herein, the parties hereby agree that the terms and conditions set out below shall be added as an addendum to the Agreement.  Except where context requires otherwise, references in this AI Addendum to the Agreement are to the Agreement as amended by, and including, this AI Addendum.

1. <strong>USE OF AI FUNCTIONALITY</strong>

    1. <strong>Representations and Warranties; Client Responsibilities</strong>.

By accessing or using the Services made available through the Enterprise Health Solution, Client agrees to only use the Services in the manner and for the purposes as set forth in this AI Addendum and the Agreement.  The artificial intelligence or machine learning functionality available on the Services (the "AI Functionality") is intended for use only by Client.  By accessing or using the AI Functionality, Client agrees that the AI Functionality is: (1) intended for the purpose of supporting or providing recommendations to Client; (2) intended for the purpose of enabling the Client to independently review the basis for such recommendations that the AI Functionality presents.  The Client shall not rely primarily on any of such recommendations from the AI Functionality to make a clinical diagnosis or treatment decision regarding an individual patient.  Without limiting the foregoing, Client acknowledges and agrees that any examples of potential diagnoses or other output generated using the AI Functionality may be incorrect, harmful, or biased, and Client will not rely on or substitute such examples or output for Client's own professional judgment or the professional judgment of Client's medical and healthcare professionals.  The Client shall not use the AI Functionality without the judgment of a qualified health care provider with the ability to take into account individual circumstances of each patient's or employee's case.  The information contained in or provided by the AI Functionality is offered solely for Client's consideration and is subject to Client's verification.  It is not to be taken as a warranty or representation by which Supplier assumes legal responsibility.  Client expressly acknowledges and agrees that Supplier is not responsible for the results or outcomes of any decisions made based on Client's use of the AI Functionality and that Client is solely responsible for all decisions made, advice given, actions taken, and failures to act based on their use of the AI Functionality.  Further, Client shall require its End Users to execute an end user agreement in a form substantially similar to this AI Addendum prior to the use of the AI Functionality.

    2. <strong>Practice of Medicine</strong>

Client shall not use the AI Functionality or the outputs generated from the AI Functionality for the practice of medicine, including for the purposes of preventing, diagnosing, or treating a disease or condition; provided, however, that nothing in this AI Addendum shall preclude Client, in its sole discretion, from permitting a duly licensed and qualified professional, who: (a) is authorized to practice medicine in the relevant jurisdiction; and (b) has been trained and is otherwise qualified in such professional's applicable scope of practice; to (c) use the AI Functionality in connection with the prevention, diagnostic, or treatment services as such professional sees fit, within the scope of such professional's qualifications and job duties, subject to such professional's sole discretion and judgment, and pursuant to such professional's review and verification of all data, outputs, and information relied upon in providing such services.
