We have moved our quality of care and reporting resources. General documentation and submission information can be found and reviewed under our [Quality Reporting](../programs/quality-reporting.md) program. Otherwise, navigate the [General Functionality](../functions.md) section to further investigate the details of the overall [Quality of Care](../functions/quality-of-care.md) module and basic enrollment.
