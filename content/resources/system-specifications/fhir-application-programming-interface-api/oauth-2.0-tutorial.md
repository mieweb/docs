# OAuth 2.0 Overview  
  
OAuth 2.0 is the industry standard for allowing external applications access to protected resources. Additional information about the technology may be found at [https://oauth.net/2/](https://oauth.net/2/).

  
## App Registration  
  
Applications can be registered within the Login Trusts editor within the EHR. Contact your implementation specialist for assistance.
  
## Patient Standalone Launch  
  
Registered applications can utilize the OAuth 2.0 authorization code workflow in order to access the EHR.

Utilizing applications conforming to the SMART launch workflow, users will be directed to the EHR's Scope confirmation page.

On this page, individual accesses may be customized or denied altogether.

If allowed, the application will then be permitted to access the user's data via the FHIR API.
  
## EHR Launch  
  
The Quickview contains a FHIR Launch portlet which allows launching configured applications.

Navigate to the Quickview sidemenu tab

The EHR supports authentication of JWT access tokens via out of band supplied JWKS url.
