## Deployment Strategy

{{% system-name %}} adopts Terraform for seamless integration across various AWS environments, ensuring consistency in deployment for GovCloud, FedRAMP-compliant setups, and commercial AWS environments. This strategy, backed by [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) automation and AWS-managed services, guarantees high standards of reliability, security, and scalability while meeting stringent compliance requirements.

## Utilizing AWS Managed Services

* [Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/)
* [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
* [Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/)
* [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

{{% system-name %}} prioritizes leveraging AWS-managed services such as RDS for databases, S3 for file storage, ElastiCache for performance enhancement, and others. This approach optimizes deployment efficiency, scalability, and maintenance, ensuring uniformity across different AWS environments.

## Benefits of AWS Managed Services

RDS streamlines database management tasks, while EC2 instances, specifically running Amazon Linux 2, handle application server workloads. ElastiCache boosts performance by caching user preferences, and reducing database round trips. Meanwhile, S3 acts as a reliable repository for storing various document types. This orchestrated use of managed services not only facilitates deployment but also enhances system performance and scalability for {{% system-name %}} operations.

## RDS

### Minimum requirements

Instance Type: [db.t3.xlarge](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/instance-types/)

Memory: 16 GiB

Storage: 50 GB

Number of vCPUs: 4

## EC2

Beyond hosting the {{% system-name %}} application, EC2 instances dynamically scale through automated processes. By employing auto-scaling and elastic load balancing, the system efficiently adjusts to varying workloads, optimizing resource utilization without compromising performance or stability. This architecture ensures consistent availability, reliability, and responsiveness under fluctuating traffic conditions, providing users with a smooth experience.

### Operating Systems

The {{% system-name %}} application is engineered to seamlessly operate across a spectrum of operating systems, encompassing various Red Hat and Debian variants. Whether it's CentOS 7, CentOS 8, Rocky Linux, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Amazon Linux 2, Debian 11, Debian 12, or similar distributions within these families, the application boasts compatibility across this diverse range. Its design and architecture ensure adaptability and smooth functionality across these operating systems, offering enterprises the flexibility to deploy the application on their preferred platform without compromising performance or reliability.

Moreover, the {{% system-name %}} application extends its compatibility to specialized environments such as GovCloud, meeting stringent security requirements like FedRAMP. It seamlessly integrates with [CIS Amazon Linux 2 STIG Benchmark](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-i3vkpa6e3rfk6), ensuring compliance and adherence to the highest security standards mandated for government and federal agencies' cloud deployments.

### Minimum requirements

Instance Type: [C5a.2xlarge](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c5/)

Memory: 16 GiB

Storage: 250 GB

Number of vCPUs: 8

### Encryption / Protocols

All EC2 instances use encrypted EBS volumes (see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html) and utilize TLS 1.3 for client connections.

## ElastiCache

Instance Type: cache.t2.small

## S3

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) stands as a robust and reliable solution for file storage, offering a myriad of advantages, especially in the realms of multi-region support and disaster recovery.

### Multi-Region Redundancy

One of the key strengths of Amazon S3 lies in its ability to replicate data across multiple geographic regions. This multi-region replication ensures that your files are redundantly stored in different physical locations, mitigating the risk of data loss due to regional outages, natural disasters, or unforeseen incidents. By distributing data across various regions, Amazon S3 significantly enhances data durability and availability.

### High Durability and Availability

Amazon S3 boasts exceptional durability, designed to sustain the concurrent loss of data in multiple facilities, making it an ideal choice for critical data storage. The service offers a [service level agreement (SLA)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/sla/) guaranteeing high availability, ensuring that your files are accessible whenever needed.

### Data Lifecycle Management

It provides versatile data lifecycle management tools, enabling automatic tiering of data based on access patterns. Frequently accessed data can reside in a more readily accessible storage class, while less frequently accessed or archival data can be moved to lower-cost storage tiers, optimizing cost-efficiency without compromising accessibility.

### Scalability and Performance

Amazon S3's architecture is built to handle virtually limitless scalability. It accommodates a vast amount of data and sustains high throughput, catering to the needs of businesses with growing storage requirements. Additionally, it offers strong consistency and low latency, ensuring swift access to stored files.

### Security and Compliance

The platform implements robust security measures, including encryption both in transit and at rest, access control mechanisms, and compliance certifications, assuring the protection of sensitive data and adherence to regulatory standards.

### Cost-Effectiveness

Amazon S3's tiered storage options enable cost optimization by allowing users to select storage classes that best suit their data access needs, thereby minimizing storage expenses.

In summary, Amazon S3 emerges as a powerhouse for file storage due to its multi-region redundancy, high durability, scalability, performance, security measures, compliance adherence, and cost-effectiveness. Its ability to safeguard data across different geographical regions while ensuring accessibility makes it an ideal choice for businesses and organizations seeking a secure and reliable storage solution with robust disaster recovery capabilities.
