The following page documents the minimum required hardware and software to properly load and run the web-based  {{% system-name %}} application.
  
## **Practice Requirements**  
  
Regardless of the size of the practice these hardware requirements will not change. A practice decides the number of locations and devices necessary to support their workflow; MIE can provide workflow specialists to assist with this process.
  
### **Windows Workstation**  
  
Minimum requirements:
* Pentium 4 class or better or AMD equivalent
* 2 GB RAM or higher (4 GB RAM recommended)
* 1024 X 768 screen resolution or better
* Windows 10 operating system (business versions preferred)
  
### **Apple Workstation**  
  
Minimum requirements:
* OS Leopard or higher
  
### **Internet Browser**  
  
Browser requirements:
* IE, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and other up-to-date browsers are supported
* Internet Explorer 11 or higher is required for all ActiveX components

A few very specific features of {{% system-name %}} require the richness of ActiveX (such as dictation controls, advanced diagnostic viewing of DICOM images, batch indexing of chart contents, as examples), and therefore users of those features are required to use IE.  
The vast majority of {{% system-name %}} content is viewable through Mozilla-type browsers, Opera, Chrome, Safari and Internet Explorer, without the need to load software or even ActiveX controls on a PC.
  
### **PDA & Mobile Devices**  
  
{{% system-name %}} is accessible on any mobile device connected to the Internet that includes a browser. {{% system-name %}} detects the use of a pocket sized device and optimizes the content for use with these devices. {{% system-name %}} is tested to work with WebKit based browsers (Safari and Chrome) on mobile platforms iOS and Android.
  
## **Additional Software**  
  
The following software works with {{% system-name %}} , but is not required:
* Microsoft Word
* AlternaTIFF
* Adobe Acrobat Reader
  
### **Devices**  
  
Peripheral workstation devices used in conjunction with the {{% system-name %}} application include:
* Printers
* High Speed and ADF Scanners (TWAIN Compliant)
* Card Scanners (TWAIN Compliant)
* Dictation Devices (USB Microphones, Foot Pedals and Digital Recorders)
* Transcription foot pedals

{{% note %}}
Some of the {{% system-name %}} functions require the use of an ActiveX control for the Browser where hardware control is required (scanner control, video-capture, serial interfaces for device capture, and printer driver capture). {{% system-name %}} has an HTML rich text editor so MS Word is not required for word processing. However, users who need Access/MS Word templates do require that MSOffice is loaded on their PC.
