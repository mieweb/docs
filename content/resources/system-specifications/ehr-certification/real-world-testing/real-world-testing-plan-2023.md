## Justification for Real World Testing Approach  
  
WebChart EHR is a cloud-based, fully-inclusive EHR solution.  All certified functionality is delivered in all instances of the product regardless of the care setting, size of practice, or required use cases for a given practice.  Each production client is maintained in a separate database; however, the implementation of the environment is identical with the exception of optional increased security protocols that a client may choose to add for enhanced data protection. Additionally, the only differences between the client-facing portion of each system are a result of configuration settings that can be selected at go-live or updated at any time during a client's contract.  Due to this philosophy of product delivery, all certified capabilities may not be actively used in all marketed care settings or may not be actively used in any current client production system.  To address the Real World Testing requirements, MIE will be using a hybrid approach.  Testing will primarily be conducted using de-identified real patient data from production systems as recorded in database tables and log files.  For those criteria for which this live production recording is not available or minimal due to lack of client usage, client reported issues will be tracked and reported in addition to enacting automated tests of the certified functionality in a test system in a production environment.  The automated tests will be run daily or weekly as appropriate in a system that is identical in substance and delivery to a client production system with the only exception being live real patient data.  This blended approach will allow MIE to prove ongoing maintenance of WebChart EHR's certified technology regardless of the level of implementation by current clients.

  
## Standards Updates ([SVAP](https://www.healthit.gov/topic/standards-version-advancement-process-svap) and USCDI)  
  
All certified criteria in WebChart EHR use the current standard or implementation specification version, and will continue conformance to that version throughout the 2023 Real World Testing period unless stated in the table below. Key current versions include the following:

## Care Setting(s)  
  
WebChart EHR is a scalable, web-based system designed for ambulatory practices and clinics.  The same product is distributed to all care settings with many configuration options.  Each practice can use the available configuration to tailor the product to fit their workflows and use requirements.


<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Care Setting</strong></td>
<td><strong>Justification</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Primary Care</td>
<td>The WebChart EHR clients are divided primarily between primary care and specialty practices.  Testing in a primary care setting will cover a large and important portion of our business.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Specialty Practice</td>
<td>The WebChart EHR clients are divided primarily between primary care and specialty practices.  Configuration selections are all that differentiate WebChart EHR implementations; however, we will test with several specialty practices to ensure configuration does not impact the functionality of certified capabilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pediatrics</td>
<td>Pediatric clinics are typically configured differently than adult primary care clinics.  We will test in a pediatric setting in addition to primary care to again ensure that configuration does not impact the functionality of certified capabilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Small/Rural/Underserved Practice</td>
<td>The size and location of a practice can impact their interoperability options.  We will test with both small/rural and large/urban practices to ensure all practices have full interoperability functionality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Large Multi-practice Clinic</td>
<td>The size and location of a practice can impact their interoperability options.  We will test with both small/rural and large/urban practices to ensure all practices have full interoperability functionality.</td>

</tr>

</table>


  
#### Justification  
  
WebChart EHR should accommodate the full range of §170.315(c)(1), §170.315(c)(2), and §170.315(c)(3) to support providers participating in MIPS and other quality measures.  Most data supporting these measures for existing clients will come from data generated internally by their standard clinical workflows of seeing patients or incorporating the CCDA of transitioning patients.  Numerical compliance calculations and reporting will be monitored by MIE and the practices selected for testing.  The export and report QRDA formats will be validated by reporting partners and Cypress CUV+ to ensure data collected and calculated in WebChart EHR remains interoperable.
  
#### Test Methodology  
  
First, MIE will install an instance of Cypress 7+ on our production servers following all of our protocols for maintaining the security of PHI.  Cypress CUV+ supports the validation of QRDA reports containing PHI and will be used monthly to validate a random selection of QRDAs from the care settings identified.  Any errors identified by Cypress CUV+ will be tracked, reported, and addressed, then followed with testing of a larger sample of files.  
Additionally, WebChart EHR has two customers that participate in quarterly attestations using both QRDA I and QRDA III reports.  These customers regularly inspect their CQM compliance numbers and will alert MIE to any perceived errors.  MIE will then collect and track the attestation results from the reporting bodies including any errors so as to report a success/failure rate.
  
#### Expected Outcome(s)  
  
It is expected that calculation, reporting, and QRDA format errors will be rare.  Any errors reported by customers or the recipients of their quarterly attestations will be tracked and reported as a baseline.  Additionally, any formatting or coding errors identified by Cypress CUV+ will be tracked, reported, and resolved.  These errors are also expected to be rare both before and after using SVAP to update the version of QRDA WebChart EHR supports.
  
#### Care Setting(s)  
  
Primary care, specialties, pediatrics, small, large
  
### Measure 2: Clinical Quality Measures Incoming  

  
#### Description  
  
This measure will review WebChart EHR's ability to measure clinical quality and export the required information.  Compliance will be tested both manually by developers and clients as well as automatically by reporting bodies and the Cypress CUV+ test system.

</table>
  
#### Justification  
  
WebChart EHR should accommodate the full range of §170.315(c)(1), §170.315(c)(2), and §170.315(c)(3) to support providers participating in MIPS and other quality measures.  It is rare that an active production client will import a QRDA I file for use in their CQM calculations.  To maintain that WebChart EHR is capable of importing and calculating when this does occur, QRDA I files from Cypress will be imported into a test system in a production environment, CQMs will be automatically calculated, and QRDA files will be exported back to Cypress for content and calculation validation.
  
#### Test Methodology  
  
MIE will install an instance of Cypress 7+ on our production servers following all of our protocols for maintaining the security of PHI.  Automated testing will download QRDA I files from Cypress for each certified CQM, import the files to WebChart EHR, calculate the CQMs, and export the QRDA files for Cypress validation of both the content and calculations to verify that the import was successful.  Any errors identified by Cypress will be tracked, reported, and addressed.
  
#### Expected Outcome(s)  
  
It is expected that calculation, reporting, and QRDA format errors will be rare.  Any formatting, content, or calculation errors identified by Cypress will be tracked, reported, and resolved.  These errors are expected to be rare both before and after using SVAP to update the version of QRDA WebChart EHR supports.
  
#### Care Setting(s)  
  
Primary Care, specialties, small, large
  
### Measure 3: E-Prescribing Messages Sent and Received  

  
#### Description  
  
This measure will verify that all supported e-prescribing message types are in use in WebChart EHR, including inbound and outbound message types.
  
#### Associated Certification Criteria

</tr>

</table>
  
#### Justification  
  
WebChart EHR should support all of the required e-prescribing messaging types outlined in §170.315(b)(3). Messages are stored locally in each client system in addition to being transmitted to/from pharmacies via the Surescripts network. 

  
#### Test Methodology  
  
MIE will report a count of messages for each supported message type:
* NewRx
* RxChangeRequest
* RxChangeResponse
* CancelRx
* CancelRxResponse
* RxRenewalRequest
* RxRenewalResponse
* RxFill
* RxHistoryRequest
* RxHistoryResponse
* Status
* Error
* Verify
The report will also include a count of outbound messages unable to be transmitted due to connectivity issues or other errors, for each message type. This report will be based on the contents of each client's local database table of stored messages. MIE will run the report for each client under consideration and aggregate the results.
  
#### Expected Outcome(s)  
  
Each of the supported message types should have a total greater than zero,and the number of outbound messages with errors should be significantly lower than the total number attempted to be sent. Based on past usage patterns of outbound message types, the number of NewRx messages is anticipated to be greater than RxChangeResponse, CancelRx, or RxRenewalResponse.
  
#### Care Setting(s)  
  
Primary care, specialties, pediatrics, small, large
  
### Measure 4: E-Prescribing Diagnosis Codes  

  
#### Description  
  
This measure will verify that all diagnosis elements are present in some e-prescribing messages as required by §170.315(b)(3), including inbound and outbound message types.
  
#### Associated Certification Criteria  


<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Certification Criteria</strong></td>
<td><strong>Requirement(s)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://www.healthit.gov/test-method/electronic-prescribing#cures_tp">§170.315(b)(3): Electronic prescribing</a></td>
<td>(b)(3)(ii)(C)(1) - Primary/Secondary Diagnosis</td>
</tr>

</table>
  
#### Justification  
  
WebChart EHR must be able to send Diagnosis codes in outbound e-prescribing messages, and receive inbound messages that include them.
  
#### Test Methodology  
  
MIE will report the contents of each stored message in a client's local database table of stored messages, and counts the inbound and outbound messages that include Diagnosis elements. MIE will run the report for each client under consideration and aggregate the results.
  
#### Expected Outcome(s)  
  
As Diagnosis code is not a required element for transmission, we expect that these elements will be present in some, but not all inbound and outbound messages.
  
#### Care Setting(s)  
  
Primary care, specialties, pediatrics, small, large

  
### Measure 5: E-Prescribing Oral Liquid Units  

  
#### Description  
  
This measure will verify that prescriptions for medications with an oral liquid form will have a quantity unit of measurement of mL, not cc or English units as outlined in §170.315(b)(3).
  
#### Associated Certification Criteria  


<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Certification Criteria</strong></td>
<td><strong>Requirement(s)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://www.healthit.gov/test-method/electronic-prescribing#cures_tp">§170.315(b)(3): Electronic prescribing</a></td>
<td>(b)(3)(ii)(E) - Metric Units</td>
</tr>

</table>
  
#### Justification  
  
WebChart EHR should prevent prescriptions of oral liquid medications from being sent electronically if they have an inappropriate quantity unit of measurement.
  
#### Test Methodology  
  
MIE will create a system report that examines the contents of each stored NewRx message in a client's local database table of stored messages, limiting to oral liquid medications, and provides a count of each distinct quantity unit of measure used. MIE will run the report for each client under consideration and aggregate the results.
  
#### Expected Outcome(s)  
  
It is expected that code C28254 (milliliters) to be the most commonly sent unit of measure for oral liquid medications. Others should be extremely rare.
  
#### Care Setting(s)  
  
Primary care, specialties, pediatrics, small, large


  
### Measure 6: E-Prescribing Decimal Format  

  
#### Description  
  
This measure will verify that numeric amounts in prescriptions include leading zeros before decimal points and do not allow trailing zeros after a decimal point.
  
#### Associated Certification Criteria  


<table>

<td><strong>Requirement(s)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://www.healthit.gov/test-method/electronic-prescribing#cures_tp">§170.315(b)(3): Electronic prescribing</a></td>
<td>(b)(3)(ii)(F) - Decimal Format</td>
</tr>

</table>
  
#### Justification  
  
WebChart EHR should prevent prescriptions from being sent electronically if they have directions or total quantity that are missing leading zeros or include trailing zeros.  This is essential for preventing misunderstanding by pharmacists regarding the amount to dispense and patients regarding the amount of medication to take.
  
#### Test Methodology  
  
MIE will create a system report that examines the contents of each stored NewRx message in a client's local database table of stored messages, and provides a count of prescription messages that include inappropriate trailing zeros, and a count of those missing leading zeros. MIE will run the report for each client under consideration and aggregate the results.
  
#### Expected Outcome(s)  
  
It is expected that prescriptions sent including inappropriate trailing zeros, or missing needed leading zeros will be very rare.
  
#### Care Setting(s)  
  
Primary care, specialties, small, large
  
### Measure 7: CDA Download  

  
#### Description  
  
This measure will verify that the system can accept a CDA document uploaded into the system, assign it to the appropriate chart in the system as appropriate, and display the document with a standard stylesheet with all sections being accepted and visible.

#### Justification  
  
Webchart EHR should be able to accept a CDA document and place it into the correct chart based on information within the document.  It should also be able to display the CDA documents with an appropriate stylesheet.
  
#### Test Methodology  
  
MIE will report on the number of CDA formatted documents uploaded into tracked Webchart systems and the number of upload attempts that failed as stored in client databases and error log files.  
MIE will report on the number of requests to view a CDA document within the system, and the number of times it displayed correctly, and when there were errors in display.  
Any errors reported by customers or the recipients of their quarterly attestations will be tracked and reported as a baseline.  These test assumptions for customer reporting align with the "visual inspection" aspects of the test lab tests.
  
#### Expected Outcome(s)  
  
It is expected that CDA upload and stylesheet errors will be rare.  Any errors reported by customers or the recipients of their quarterly attestations will be tracked and reported as a baseline.

</table>
  
#### Justification  
  
Webchart EHR should be able to reconcile CCDA data for medications, allergies, and conditions into a patient's chart as outlined in § 170.315(b)(2).
  
#### Test Methodology  
  
MIE will report on the number of CDA formatted documents reconciled via our reconciliation process.  
Following each reconcile, if a temporary CDA for the chart is created as part of the process, it will be validated to ensure the reconciled data can be incorporated into a CDA created free of schematic errors (the CDA document will *NOT* be kept, only the result of the validation).  Additionally, any client complaints that data is not being imported correctly from the tool will be tracked, investigated, and reported.
  
#### Expected Outcome(s)  
  
It is expected that errored reconciliations and invalid CDA checks should be extremely rare.
  
#### Care Setting(s)  
  
Primary care, specialties, small, large

#### Justification  
  
WebChart EHR should be able to provide a mechanism for a patient to transmit documents sent to them within a patient portal to other entities.
  
#### Test Methodology  
  
MIE will report a number of measurements surrounding documents, including:
* Number of documents made available to patients in the patient portal
* Number of documents successfully transmitted from the patient portal 
* Number of documents unsuccessful in being transmitted from the patient portal. 
Results will be retrieved from database tables and aggregated for reporting.  Any failures will be reported from the information found in log files and third party reports as well as any client reported issues tracked during the testing period.
  
#### Expected Outcome(s)  
  
There is expected to be an possibly extremely low occurrence of messages unable to be transmitted from the patient portal to third parties.  
  
MIE may produce test messages to transmit to mieweb.com and ccme.com (our Direct compliant email domain) to validate this functionality if necessary. 
  
#### Care Setting(s)  
  
Primary, specialties, small, large
  
### Measure 17: Send Using Edge Protocol for SMTP / XDM

#### Test Methodology  
  
MIE will report from logs the number of messages transmitted to the HISP by SMTP.  MIE will report from logs the number of messages received from the HISP by SMTP.  MIE will report from logs the number of XDM packages processed.  In the case where insufficient real-world data is available, data resulting from regular testing with DirectTrust shall be included in the reporting.
  
#### Expected Outcome(s)  
  
It is expected that the current usage shall be low, with the exception of regular DirectTrust testing.  Any errors resulting from real-world transmission of messages are expected to be rare, but may skew results due to the low volume of transmitted messages.
  
#### Care Setting(s)  
  
Primary, specialties, pediatrics, small, large
  
### Measure 18: Data Export

#### Justification  
  
Webchart EHR should be able to provide a mechanism for a user to download patient chart information via CDA from a large set of patients within the system as outlined in §170.315(b)(6).  This tool is publicly available ([https://github.com/mieweb/wcexport](https://github.com/mieweb/wcexport)).
  
#### Test Methodology  
  
MIE will report from the event log database tables a series of occurrences that indicates use of the WebChart EHR Data Export Tool:
* Event logs of the report to find all patients for Document Export being called.
* Event logs of CDA documents being generated within a certain short time period following the report. 

MIE will track customer reports of data expected to be in mass data export downloads that did not download as failures.
  
#### Expected Outcome(s)  
  
It is expected that there will be an extremely low occurrence of data exports unable to be downloaded from a Webchart EHR.  
  
If there is a lack of data exports in a certain timeframe by patients within the workflow, MIE may conduct internal testing of data export to maintain measure compliance.
  
#### Care Setting(s)  
  
Primary, specialties, small, large
  
### Measure 19: CDA Validation  

  
#### Description  
  
This measure will verify that CDAs both created by and received by a Webchart EHR system pass basic CDA validation.
  
#### Associated Certification Criteria

</tr>

</table>
  
#### Justification  
  
Webchart EHR should be able to validate that CDAs that are stored within webchart either do or do not conform to basic CDA schema requirements.
  
#### Test Methodology  
  
All CDAs stored within a Webchart EHR will be run through schema validation regardless of the document's origin.  Documents may originate within the WebChart EHR system or be imported from a third party application of manual upload.  The schema validator will be installed within the MIE production environment to ensure the security of all PHI contained in the documents.  Only results of the validation will be made available, document content will not be revealed to developers during testing.

The number of valid vs. invalid CDAs and their sources will be reported.
  
#### Expected Outcome(s)  
  
Any formatting or stylesheet errors identified by the CDA validator will be tracked, reported, and resolved.  These errors are expected to be rare for documents created by WebChart EHR.  If CDA documents received from third parties are identified to have schematic errors, those third parties will be notified whenever possible.
  
#### Care Setting(s)  
  
Primary, specialties, small, large
  
### Measure 20: Patient Data requests VIA API  

  
#### Description

</table>
  
#### Justification  
  
WebChart EHR should provide patient information to requesters with the proper access to the information. In production environments of WebChart EHR, the use of the documented API is rare; therefore, MIE will conduct dual level testing of the API first, using automated testing of a test system in a production environment and second, manually tracking any client reported issues with the API functionality against the automatically tracked API requests are made.
  
#### Test Methodology  
  
To address the overall automated testing, the following test requests will be made daily against a test system in a production environment.
* Issue a request in the browser to search for a patient (patient selection)
* Issue a request in the browser to request demographics of a patient (data category request)
* Issue a request using the export tool described in the documentation.
All API requests made in production systems are recorded in log files.  The number of requests logged will be reported against the number of issues with API functionality that are reported.

  
#### Expected Outcome(s)  
  
It is expected that automated testing will be successful more than 97% of the time.  Any errors will be logged and reported; however, errors are expected to be minimal, such as a lost server connection.  Both production uses of the API and reports of errors are expected to be rare.
  
#### Care Setting(s)  
  
Primary care, specialties, pediatrics, small, large
  
### Measure 21: Web Content Accessibility

</tr>

</table>
  
#### Justification  
  
The certified content of the patient portal should be accessible to all users regardless of abilities or impairments as outlined in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0.
  
#### Test Methodology  
  
MIE will conduct monthly third-party production accessibility scanning as well as automated nightly internal accessibility scanning of a test system in a production environment.
  
#### Expected Outcome(s)  
  
It is expected that no urgent non-conformance issues will be identified and that the number of secondary issues will be minimal.  Any non-conformance that reaches a production system will be tracked and reported.
  
#### Care Setting(s)  
  
Primary care, specialties, pediatrics, small, large

  
### Measure 22: FHIR API Documentation  

  
#### Description  
  
This measure will verify that WebChart EHR's FHIR API documentation is publicly and perpetually available.  Compliance will be recorded by an external uptime monitor and reported quarterly.

</tr>

</table>
  
#### Justification  
  
WebChart EHR should provide public access to all FHIR API documentation, software components, software configurations, registration instructions, and terms of use as outlined in 170.315(g)(10).  This documentation should be available at all times throughout the year.
  
#### Test Methodology  
  
An external uptime monitor will check the availability of all documentation available at [https://docs.webchartnow.com/resources/system-specifications/fhir-application-programming-interface-api/](https://docs.webchartnow.com/resources/system-specifications/fhir-application-programming-interface-api/) and the linked subpages.  Both up- and downtime will be logged to be reported quarterly.  The cause of any downtime and the duration will also be logged   In the event of any downtime, the amount of downtime can be reported at daily, weekly, or monthly intervals in addition to the quarterly reports, and the cause of each downtime occurrence will be reported.
  
#### Expected Outcome(s)  
  
It is expected that all documentation will maintain an uptime of greater than 99.9%.  Any downtime is expected to be caused by minor errors, such as a connection timeout or planned maintenance, and last for a duration of 10 minutes or less.
  
#### Care Setting(s)

<td>(b)(7)</td>
</tr>

</table>
  
#### Justification  
  
WebChart EHR per certification requirements must be able to generate CCDA Documents with valid security tags.
  
#### Test Methodology  
  
We will have automated tests that run at minimum weekly to test that the software is still able to generate CCDAs with Security Tags.

If we determine that we are seeing usage of the security tagging within Production systems, we will report:
* the number of CCDAs generated during the RWT period.
* The number of CCDAs with security tags generated during the RWT period.
  
#### Expected Outcome(s)  
  
We expect our software to show constant ability to generate CCDA documents with Security Tags.  
From discussions with others around the industry who interact with large usage of CDA creation and transmission, there is little to no usage of DS4P within documents created by systems currently.   We do not anticipate client usage of security tags in generated CCDA documents as well either, at least to start with in 2023.  If this changes we will update the testing to accommodate tracking those numbers as listed above.
  
#### Care Setting(s)  
  
Primary care, specialties, pediatrics, small, large

<td>(g)(10)(vi) - Patient authorization revocation</td>
</tr>

</table>
  
#### Justification  
  
WebChart EHR's FHIR API is still newly available to clients and has no adoption as of writing this plan.  Therefore to cover testing prior to live clients actively using the API, a publicly available production sandbox will be tested using Inferno.  FHIR adoption is expected to be slow, but increasing, throughout 2023 leading to improved app support in WebChart EHR as well as increased real world data being available, at which time, Measures 30 and 31 will provide a more complete view of the production FHIR capabilities.
  
#### Test Methodology  
  
MIE will run nightly automated testing on the public FHIR R4 sandbox system using Inferno, and using log files stored in a QA database, MIE will report the success rate of the full (g)(10) test suite.  Any errors will be tracked, reported, and addressed.
  
#### Expected Outcome(s)  
  
It is expected that test failures will be rare and that the automated tests will pass successfully in a minimum of 95% of nightly runs.  Any failures are expected to be due to a failure in the testing infrastructure rather than in the functionality of the API. 
  
#### Care Setting(s)  
  
Primary care, specialties, pediatrics, small, large
  
### Measure 30: FHIR Patient Scope  

  
#### Description  
  
This measure will review WebChart EHR's ability to connect to an app within a patient scope and provide the user with the requested data.

FHIR adoption is expected to be slow, but increasing, throughout 2023 leading to improved app support in WebChart EHR as well as increased real world data being available.  Until that time when clients are actively using the FHIR API, MIE will conduct testing using a publicly available production sandbox system and a patient app recommended to our clients.  As clients continue adoption of the FHIR API, real patient use of the patient app will be reported.

  
#### Test Methodology  
  
MIE will report from de-identified log files an analysis of authentication and data searches using a patient app.  Specific rates can be reported from the sandbox system as the automated testing setup will indicate what actions should yield successful authentication or data return.  An overall analysis will be reported for the real world patient data since we cannot estimate failures due to patients correctly being denied access.
  
#### Expected Outcome(s)  
  
It is expected that WebChart EHR will be conformant to all (g)(10) requirements and that overall error rates will be low.
  
#### Care Setting(s)  
  
Primary care, specialties, pediatrics, small, large
  
### Measure 31: FHIR EHR Provider Scope
