## Summary of Testing Methods and Key Findings

WebChart EHR is a cloud-based, fully-inclusive EHR solution.  All certified functionality is delivered in all instances of the product regardless of the care setting, size of practice, or required use cases for a given practice.  Each production client is maintained in a separate database; however, the implementation of the environment is identical with the exception of optional increased security protocols that a client may choose to add for enhanced data protection. Additionally, the only differences between the client-facing portion of each system are a result of configuration settings that can be selected at go-live or updated at any time during a client's contract.  Due to this philosophy of product delivery, all certified capabilities may not be actively used in all marketed care settings or may not be actively used in any current client production system.  To address the Real World Testing requirements, MIE will be using a hybrid approach.  Testing will primarily be conducted using de-identified real patient data from production systems as recorded in database tables and log files.  For those criteria for which this live production recording is not available or minimal due to lack of client usage, client reported issues will be tracked and reported in addition to enacting automated tests of the certified functionality in a test system in a production environment.  The automated tests will be run daily or weekly as appropriate in a system that is identical in substance and delivery to a client production system with the only exception being live real patient data.  This blended approach will allow MIE to prove ongoing maintenance of WebChart EHR's certified technology regardless of the level of implementation by current clients.

## Measures Used in Overall Approach

The following measures outline and justify how each requirement of all criteria to which WebChart EHR is certified will be tested during the 2022 Real World Testing year.  Please review the Criteria-Measure Matrix above to review which measure(s) will cover a specific requirement.

### Measure 1: Clinical Quality Measures Outgoing

#### Description

This measure will review WebChart EHR's ability to measure clinical quality and export the required information.  Compliance will be tested both manually by developers and clients as well as automatically by reporting bodies and the Cypress CUV+ test system.

#### Associated Certification Criteria

<table>

<td><strong>Certification Criteria</strong></td>
<td><strong>Requirement(s)</strong></td>

<td>(c )(3)(i) - Report</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Justification

WebChart EHR should accommodate the full range of §170.315(c)(1), §170.315(c)(2), and §170.315(c)(3) to support providers participating in MIPS and other quality measures.  Most data supporting these measures for existing clients will come from data generated internally by their standard clinical workflows of seeing patients or incorporating the CCDA of transitioning patients.  Numerical compliance calculations and reporting will be monitored by MIE and the practices selected for testing.  The export and report QRDA formats will be validated by reporting partners and Cypress CUV+ to ensure data collected and calculated in WebChart EHR remains interoperable.

#### Test Methodology

First, MIE will install an instance of Cypress 7+ on our production servers following all of our protocols for maintaining the security of PHI.  Cypress CUV+ supports the validation of QRDA reports containing PHI and will be used monthly to validate a random selection of QRDAs from the care settings identified.  Any errors identified by Cypress CUV+ will be tracked, reported, and addressed, then followed with testing of a larger sample of files.

Additionally, WebChart EHR has two customers that participate in quarterly attestations using both QRDA I and QRDA III reports.  These customers regularly inspect their CQM compliance numbers and will alert MIE to any perceived errors.  MIE will then collect and track the attestation results from the reporting bodies including any errors so as to report a success/failure rate.

### Measure 2: Clinical Quality Measures Incoming

#### Description

This measure will review WebChart EHR's ability to measure clinical quality and export the required information.  Compliance will be tested both manually by developers and clients as well as automatically by reporting bodies and the Cypress CUV+ test system.

</tr>
</table>

#### Justification

WebChart EHR should accommodate the full range of §170.315(c)(1), §170.315(c)(2), and §170.315(c)(3) to support providers participating in MIPS and other quality measures.  It is rare that an active production client will import a QRDA I file for use in their CQM calculations.  To maintain that WebChart EHR is capable of importing and calculating when this does occur, QRDA I files from Cypress will be imported into a test system in a production environment, CQMs will be automatically calculated, and QRDA files will be exported back to Cypress for content and calculation validation.

#### Test Methodology

MIE will install an instance of Cypress 7+ on our production servers following all of our protocols for maintaining the security of PHI.  Automated testing will download QRDA I files from Cypress for each certified CQM, import the files to WebChart EHR, calculate the CQMs, and export the QRDA files for Cypress validation of both the content and calculations to verify that the import was successful.  Any errors identified by Cypress will be tracked, reported, and addressed.

</table>

#### Justification

WebChart EHR should support all of the required e-prescribing messaging types outlined in §170.315(b)(3). Messages are stored locally in each client system in addition to being transmitted to/from pharmacies via the Surescripts network.

#### Test Methodology

MIE will report a count of messages for each supported message type:

    * NewRx
    * RxChangeRequest
    * RxChangeResponse
    * CancelRx
    * CancelRxResponse
    * RxRenewalRequest
    * RxRenewalResponse
    * RxFill
    * RxHistoryRequest
    * RxHistoryResponse
    * Status
    * Error
    * Verify

The report will also include a count of outbound messages unable to be transmitted due to connectivity issues or other errors, for each message type. This report will be based on the contents of each client's local database table of stored messages. MIE will run the report for each client under consideration and aggregate the results.

#### Justification

WebChart EHR per certification requirements must be able to receive CCDA Documents with security tags and properly display them to end users.

#### Test Methodology

We will have automated tests that run at minimum weekly to test that the software is still able to receive and display generate CCDAs with Security Tags.

From discussions with others around the industry who interact with large usage of CDA creation and transmission, there is little to no usage of DS4P within documents created by systems currently. If we determine that we are seeing usage of the security tagging within Production systems, we will report:

    * the number of CCDAs received during the RWT period.
    * The number of CCDAs with security tags received during the RWT period.

</tr>
<tr>
<td>(g)(10)(vi) - Patient authorization revocation</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Justification

WebChart EHR's FHIR API is still newly available to clients and has no adoption as of writing this plan.  Therefore to cover testing prior to live clients actively using the API, a publicly available production sandbox will be tested using Inferno.  FHIR adoption is expected to be slow, but increasing, throughout 2024 leading to improved app support in WebChart EHR as well as increased real world data being available, at which time, Measures 30 and 31 will provide a more complete view of the production FHIR capabilities.

#### Test Methodology

MIE will run nightly automated testing on the public FHIR R4 sandbox system using Inferno, and using log files stored in a QA database, MIE will report the success rate of the full (g)(10) test suite.  Any errors will be tracked, reported, and addressed.

FHIR adoption is expected to be slow, but increasing, throughout 2024 leading to improved app support in WebChart EHR as well as increased real world data being available.  Until that time when clients are actively using the FHIR API, MIE will conduct testing using a publicly available production sandbox system and a patient app recommended to our clients.  As clients continue adoption of the FHIR API, real patient use of the patient app will be reported.

#### Test Methodology

MIE will report from de-identified log files an analysis of authentication and data searches using a patient app.  Specific rates can be reported from the sandbox system as the automated testing setup will indicate what actions should yield successful authentication or data return.  An overall analysis will be reported for the real world patient data since we cannot estimate failures due to patients correctly being denied access.

### Measure 32: Transmission to public health agencies — syndromic surveillance: Create content

#### Description

This measure will validate that Webchart EHR can produce valid HL7 v2 ADT messages, conforming to HL7 V2.5.1 PHIN Messaging Guide Release 2.0 and associated Erratum, per a patient's admission and discharge of care, as well as new registration or demographic updates.

#### Associated Certification Criteria

<td>(f)(2) - Create content</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Justification

WebChart EHR per certification requirements must be able to produce HL7 v2 ADT messages for specific patients. It is appropriate to distinguish between ambulatory settings and emergency department, urgent care and inpatient settings.

#### Test Methodology

We have automated tests that perform the scenarios to Register a patient, admit them both for ambulatory and urgent care, make demographic updates, and discharge them. The automated tests validate that the HL7 interface constructs valid ADT messages that conform to the certification specification. RWT in Webchart EHR would include creating 3 separate Refer to Systems end points with interface specific configuration configured and 3 separate Auto Routes to capture the new registrations, demographic updates, admissions, and discharges.  When using Webchart EHR to register a patient, update demographics, admit, or discharge the system will automatically produce the HL7 messages and send them to the configured end point with the HL7 format that meets the requirements of the NIST validation tool to be accepted by the public health agency.
