## Summary of Testing Methods and Key Findings

WebChart EHR is a cloud-based, fully-inclusive EHR solution.  All certified functionality is delivered in all instances of the product regardless of the care setting, size of practice, or required use cases for a given practice.  Each production client is maintained in a separate database; however, the implementation of the environment is identical with the exception of optional increased security protocols that a client may choose to add for enhanced data protection. Additionally, the only differences between the client-facing portion of each system are a result of configuration settings that can be selected at go-live or updated at any time during a client's contract.  Due to this philosophy of product delivery, all certified capabilities may not be actively used in all marketed care settings or may not be actively used in any current client production system.  To address the Real World Testing requirements, MIE will be using a hybrid approach.  Testing will primarily be conducted using de-identified real patient data from production systems as recorded in database tables and log files.  For those criteria for which this live production recording is not available or minimal due to lack of client usage, client reported issues will be tracked and reported in addition to enacting automated tests of the certified functionality in a test system in a production environment.  The automated tests will be run daily or weekly as appropriate in a system that is identical in substance and delivery to a client production system with the only exception being live real patient data.  This blended approach will allow MIE to prove ongoing maintenance of WebChart EHR's certified technology regardless of the level of implementation by current clients.

## Measures Used in Overall Approach

The following measures first summarize the testing methods and justification used for testing each criteria requirement during the 2022 testing period.  The real world testing results collected throughout 2022 and a discussion of those results then follow.  Please review the Criteria-Measure Matrix above to review which measure(s) will cover a specific requirement.

### Measure 1: Clinical Quality Measures Outgoing

#### Description

This measure will review WebChart EHR's ability to measure clinical quality and export the required information.  Compliance will be tested both manually by developers and clients as well as automatically by reporting bodies and the Cypress CUV+ test system.

#### Associated Certification Criteria

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Certification Criteria</strong></td>
<td><strong>Requirement(s)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"CQMs – record and export" (§170.315(c)(1))</td>
<td>(c )(1)(i) - Record</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(c )(1)(ii) - Export</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"CQMs – import and calculate" (§170.315(c)(2))</td>
<td>(c )(2)(ii) - Calculate</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"CQMs – report" (§170.315(c)(3))</td>
<td>(c )(3)(i) - Report</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Test Methodology

First, MIE will install an instance of Cypress 6+ on our production servers following all of our protocols for maintaining the security of PHI.  Cypress CUV+ supports the validation of QRDA reports containing PHI and will be used monthly to validate a random selection of QRDAs from the care settings identified.  Any errors identified by Cypress CUV+ will be tracked, reported, and addressed, then followed with testing of a larger sample of files.

Additionally, WebChart EHR has two customers that participate in quarterly attestations using both QRDA I and QRDA III reports.  These customers regularly inspect their CQM compliance numbers and will alert MIE to any perceived errors.  MIE will then collect and track the attestation results from the reporting bodies including any errors so as to report a success/failure rate.

#### Results

<table>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><strong>Calculations</strong></td>
<td><strong>QRDA I</strong></td>
<td><strong>QRDA III</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Client Reported Issues</strong></td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1 warning, 1 error in a non-certified measure</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Submitted Files</strong></td>
<td>N/A</td>
<td>10567</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Submission Errors</strong></td>
<td>N/A</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Tested Files</strong></td>
<td>N/A</td>
<td>2748</td>
<td>48</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Testing Errors</strong></td>
<td>N/A</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Discussion

As expected, no errors were found in formatting or coding of the certified measures.  One warning was reported by a client where a provider NPI was included in the QRDA III file, but the provider had been removed from the client reported roster.  The provider producing the warning departed the practice mid-year causing data to be tracked in WebChart EHR for encounters that the provider performed prior to their departure.  This warning was determined to be of no impact to the eCQM certified functionality. Additionally, one QRDA III error was reported by a client where the performance rate was calculated without removing the exclusions from the denominator prior to calculation; however, since the error occurred on a non-certified measure, this error was determined to be of no impact to the certified eCQM functionality.

### Measure 2: Clinical Quality Measures Incoming

#### Description

This measure will review WebChart EHR's ability to measure clinical quality and export the required information.  Compliance will be tested both manually by developers and clients as well as automatically by reporting bodies and the Cypress CUV+ test system.

#### Associated Certification Criteria

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Certification Criteria</strong></td>
<td><strong>Requirement(s)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"CQMs – import and calculate" (§170.315(c)(2))</td>
<td>(c )(2)(i) - Import</td>

<tr>
<td>(c )(2)(ii) - Calculate</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"CQMs – report" (§170.315(c)(3))</td>
<td>(c )(3)(i) - Report</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Test Methodology

MIE will install an instance of Cypress 6+ on our production servers following all of our protocols for maintaining the security of PHI.  Automated testing will download QRDA I files from Cypress for each certified CQM, import the files to WebChart EHR, calculate the CQMs, and export the QRDA files for Cypress validation of both the content and calculations to verify that the import was successful.  Any errors identified by Cypress will be tracked, reported, and addressed.

#### Results

<table>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><strong>QRDA I</strong></td>
<td><strong>QRDA III</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Tested Files</strong></td>
<td>2808</td>
<td>48</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Testing Errors</strong></td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Discussion

As expected, no errors were found in formatting or coding of the certified measures.

### Measure 3: E-Prescribing Messages Sent and Received

#### Description

This measure will verify that all supported e-prescribing message types are in use in WebChart EHR, including inbound and outbound message types.

#### Associated Certification Criteria

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Certification Criteria</strong></td>
<td><strong>Requirement(s)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"Electronic prescribing" (§170.315(b)(3))</td>
<td>(b)(3)(ii)(A)(1) - NewRx</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(b)(3)(ii)(A)(2) - RxChangeRequest, RxChangeResponse</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(b)(3)(ii)(A)(3) - CancelRx, CancelRxResponse</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>(b)(3)(ii)(A)(8) - Error</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(b)(3)(ii)(A)(9) - Verify</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Test Methodology

MIE will report a count of messages for each supported message type:

* NewRx
* RxChangeRequest
* RxChangeResponse
* CancelRx
* CancelRxResponse
* RxRenewalRequest
* RxRenewalResponse
* RxFill
* RxHistoryRequest
* RxHistoryResponse
* Status
* Error
* Verify

The report will also include a count of outbound messages unable to be transmitted due to connectivity issues or other errors, for each message type. This report will be based on the contents of each client's local database table of stored messages. MIE will run the report for each client under consideration and aggregate the results.

Total error rate: 5129 / 2094062 * 100 = 0.24%

#### Discussion

As expected, all supported message types have a greater than zero total message count, and the total number of messages far exceeds the number of errored messages with a total error rate of 0.24%.  Over the four quarters the error rate fluctuated from a low of 0.22% in Q2 to a high of 0.26% in Q3. This shows an overall low error rate for the whole year of 2022.  Additionally, the number of NewRx messages is significantly greater than the number of RxChangeResponse, CancelRx, and RxRenewalResponse messages.

### Measure 4: E-Prescribing Diagnosis Codes

#### Description

This measure will verify that all diagnosis elements are present in some e-prescribing messages as required by §170.315(b)(3), including inbound and outbound message types.

#### Associated Certification Criteria

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Certification Criteria</strong></td>
<td><strong>Requirement(s)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"Electronic prescribing" (§170.315(b)(3))</td>
<td>(b)(3)(ii)(C)(1) - Primary/Secondary Diagnosis</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Test Methodology

MIE will report the contents of each stored message in a client's local database table of stored messages, and counts the inbound and outbound messages that include Diagnosis elements. MIE will run the report for each client under consideration and aggregate the results.

#### Results

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Total NewRx Messages</strong></td>
<td><strong>NewRx Messages with Diagnosis Included</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>437559</td>
<td>126844</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Discussion

Since the Diagnosis elements are not a required component of a NewRx message, as anticipated, only a subset (28.99%) of the NewRx messages included a diagnosis. The rate of NewRx messages with a diagnosis included fluctuated from 26.53% in Q1 to 31.16% in Q4 showing an increasing rate of using the diagnosis element.

### Measure 5: E-Prescribing Oral Liquid Units

#### Description

This measure will verify that prescriptions for medications with an oral liquid form will have a quantity unit of measurement of mL, not cc or English units as outlined in §170.315(b)(3).

#### Associated Certification Criteria

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Certification Criteria</strong></td>
<td><strong>Requirement(s)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"Electronic prescribing" (§170.315(b)(3))</td>

</tr>
</table>

#### Test Methodology

MIE will create a system report that examines the contents of each stored NewRx message in a client's local database table of stored messages, limiting to oral liquid medications, and provides a count of each distinct quantity unit of measure used. MIE will run the report for each client under consideration and aggregate the results.

#### Results

[Units of Presentation](https://www.fda.gov/industry/structured-product-labeling-resources/units-presentation)

#### Discussion

As expected, C28254 (milliliters) is the most commonly sent unit of measure for oral liquid medications.  Non-C28254 units were only sent in 0.24% of oral liquid medication messages. This rate fluctuated from 0.03% in Q3 to 0.55% in Q1.

### Measure 6: E-Prescribing Decimal Format

#### Description

This measure will verify that numeric amounts in prescriptions include leading zeros before decimal points and do not allow trailing zeros after a decimal point.

#### Associated Certification Criteria

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Certification Criteria</strong></td>
<td><strong>Requirement(s)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"Electronic prescribing" (§170.315(b)(3))</td>
<td>(b)(3)(ii)(F) - Decimal Format</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Test Methodology

MIE will create a system report that examines the contents of each stored NewRx message in a client's local database table of stored messages, and provides a count of prescription messages that include inappropriate trailing zeros, and a count of those missing leading zeros. MIE will run the report for each client under consideration and aggregate the results.

#### Results

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Total NewRx Messages</strong></td>
<td><strong>NewRx Messages with Improper Decimal Format</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>437559</td>
<td>1895</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Discussion

As expected, the number of NewRx messages sent with inappropriate trailing zeros, or missing leading zeros, occurs rarely in only 0.43% of messages. This rate increased over the four quarters from 0.35% to 0.53%.

### Measure 7: CDA Download

#### Description

This measure will verify that the system can accept a CDA document uploaded into the system, assign it to the appropriate chart in the system as appropriate, and display the document with a standard stylesheet with all sections being accepted and visible.

#### Associated Certification Criteria

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Certification Criteria</strong></td>
<td><strong>Requirement(s)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"Clinical information reconciliation and incorporation" (§ 170.315(b)(2))</td>
<td>(b)(2)(ii) - <em>Correct patient.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>‘‘Transitions of care" (§ 170.315(b)(1))</td>
<td>(b)(1)(ii) - All paragraphs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(b)(1)(iii) - All paragraphs</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Test Methodology

MIE will report on the number of CDA formatted documents uploaded into tracked Webchart systems and the number of upload attempts that failed as stored in client databases and error log files.

MIE will report on the number of requests to view a CDA document within the system, and the number of times it displayed correctly, and when there were errors in display.  
Any errors reported by customers or the recipients of their quarterly attestations will be tracked and reported as a baseline.  These test assumptions for customer reporting align with the "visual inspection" aspects of the test lab tests.

#### Results

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Total CDA Documents Uploaded</strong></td>
<td>43,354</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Total CDA Document Upload Failures</strong></td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Total CDA Document Views</strong></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Total CDA Document View Reported Errors</strong></td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Total Successful CDA Views</strong></td>
<td>8,006</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Discussion

As anticipated, there were no errors in being able to upload and view valid CCDA documents.

Usage increased throughout the year, with the final quarter accounting for more than half of the numbers above (23,760 uploaded CDAs and 5,066 document views).

### Measure 8: Application Access Documentation

#### Description

This measure will verify that WebChart EHR's API documentation is publicly and perpetually available.  Compliance will be recorded by an external uptime monitor and reported quarterly.  Upon request, or in the event of downtime, data can additionally be reported in daily, weekly, or monthly increments.

#### Associated Certification Criteria

</tr>
</table>

#### Test Methodology

An external uptime monitor will check the availability of all documentation available at https://docs.webchartnow.com/resources/system-specifications/application-programming-interface-api.html.  Both up- and downtime will be logged to be reported quarterly.  The cause of any downtime and the duration will also be logged   In the event of any downtime, the amount of downtime can be reported at daily, weekly, or monthly intervals in addition to the quarterly reports, and the cause of each downtime occurrence will be reported.

#### Results

The MIE API documentation was available 99.967% of the time.

The MIE API documentation was available 99.997% of Q1.  There was a 3 minute down period on March 17, 2022 due to a connection timeout.

The MIE API documentation was available 100% of Q2.

The MIE API documentation was available 99.902% of Q3.  There were several short down-time events during July averaging 17.29 minutes per event all due to Cloudflare timeouts.

The MIE API documentation was available 99.967% of Q4.  Three instances of prolonged downtime occurred (10/14/2022: 13 minutes  -unannounced US Signal downtime issue , 10/27/2022: 5 minutes - unannounced US Signal downtime issue, 12/6/2022: 25 minutes - **** US Signal HRN Maintenance Window).

#### Discussion

As expected, the documentation maintained an uptime of greater than 99.9% at 99.967% for the year.  During any down time the API documentation would not have been available, but, no effect to end user requests for the information was reported.

### Measure 9: Clinical Information Reconciliation and Incorporation

#### Description

This measure will verify that the system can take a CCDA transition of care/referral summary formatted according to the standards adopted §170.205(a)(3) and §170.205(a)(4) and read the data for medications, allergies, and conditions from the document, reconcile those into the chart, and that the data is fully incorporated into the chart.

</tr>
<tr>
<td>(b)(2)(iv) - System Verification</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Test Methodology

MIE will report on the number of CDA formatted documents reconciled via the "Froozhie" tool.

Following each reconcile, a temporary CDA for the chart will be created and validated to ensure the reconciled data can be incorporated into a CDA created free of schematic errors (the CDA document will *NOT* be kept, only the result of the validation).  Additionally, any client complaints that data is not being imported correctly from the tool will be tracked, investigated, and reported

</tr>
</table>

#### Discussion

The use of CDA reconciliation in systems was relatively low, and no issues with the reconciliation of the documents were reported.  In the 4th quarter there was a steep decline in reconciliations because of issues with workflow from the main client using the feature.  This has been addressed and we plan to see higher numbers in the beginning of 2023 again.

The number of invalid validations were higher than anticipated.  Work is continuing to be done to rectify the issues with the CDA generation in these systems, and to put in place a more immediate notification process when invalid CDAs are generated.  Many of the issues with invalid CCDAs were because of data missing in the CCDA requests that were not handled well (empty quotes, etc) and those issues have been addressed and should not result in failures going forward.

### Measure 10: Transmission to Immunization Registry: Create Content

#### Description

This measure will verify that the system can generate a VXU conforming to the HL7 v2.5.1 standard, CDC guidance for communication to Immunization Registries and state/local guidance. The VXU messages shall contain information related to the demographics and vaccination administration record.

#### Associated Certification Criteria

<table>

<td><strong>Certification Criteria</strong></td>
<td><strong>Requirement(s)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"Transmission to immunization registries" (§ 170.315(f)(1))</td>
<td>(f)(1)(i) - Create Content</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Test Methodology

MIE will report from the database the number of successfully sent VXU messages acknowledged as received by the state immunization registry. MIE will also report from the database on the number of records rejected by the state registry due to error, whether the failure was due to registry internal errors, clinical data entry issues or a not well-formed message. Finally, MIE will report from the database the number of messages which declined to be generated due to data entry issues failing message pre-validation.

#### Results

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Successful transmission to registry</strong></td>
<td>8766</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Rejected by the registry</strong></td>
<td>72</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Declined to generate</strong></td>
<td>41</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Discussion

As expected, very few messages were rejected by the state registry. There is a small portion of the entered injections which were not able to be transmitted to the state registry due to user data entry issues.  The overall error rate for the year (rejected and declined) was 1.2%. The rate of Vaccination submission tended to be lighter during the first half of the year and ramped up substantially for the second half.

### Measure 11: Transmission to Immunization Registries: Query Records

#### Description

This measure will verify that the system can generate a QBP conforming to the HL7 v2.5.1 standard, CDC guidance for communication to Immunization Registries and state/local guidance. Furthermore, the system shall be able to retrieve, consume and display to the end user the results of any such query.

#### Associated Certification Criteria

#### Test Methodology

MIE will report a number of measurements surrounding documents, including:

* Number of documents sent successfully to patients in the patient portal
* Number of documents unsuccessfully sent to the patient portal
* Number of documents read by patients in the patient portal
* Number of failures in the ability to read messages in the patient portal

Results will be retrieved from database tables and aggregated for reporting.  Any failures will be reported from the information found in log files as well as any client reported issues tracked during the testing period.

#### Results

</table>

#### Discussion

The low number of CDA documents in the NMC patient portal was because workflows were still sending other document types instead of CDA to the patient portal.   Client workflows in 2023 are anticipated to greatly increase the number of C-CDA documents being consumed in Patient Portals in 2023.   We did not report any known failures to read a CCDA document in the NMC portal in 2023.

### Measure 15: Patient Portal Download

#### Description

This measure will verify that a patient can download various document types within the patient portal.

#### Discussion

The low number of CDA documents in the NMC patient portal was because workflows were still sending other document types instead of CDA to the patient portal.   Client workflows in 2023 are anticipated to greatly increase the number of C-CDA documents being consumed in Patient Portals in 2023.  With the low number of CDA documents in the portal, there were no reported transmission attempts of CDA documents out of the portal.  If transmissions are low, even with the increase in CCDA portal documents in 2023, we will have automated tests of transmissions of test chart documents scheduled in 2023.

### Measure 17: Send Using Edge Protocol for SMTP / XDM

#### Description

This measure will verify that the system is able to utilize a SMTP edge protocol for sending and receiving Direct Project messages. As part of receiving messages, XDM shall be handled when applicable.

#### Associated Certification Criteria

<table>

#### Test Methodology

MIE will report from logs the number of messages transmitted to the HISP by SMTP.  MIE will report from logs the number of messages received from the HISP by SMTP.  MIE will report from logs the number of XDM packages processed.  In the case where insufficient real-world data is available, data resulting from regular testing with DirectTrust shall be included in the reporting.

#### Results

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Messages submitted to HISP via SMTP</strong></td>
<td>7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Number of XDM packages processed</strong></td>
<td>346</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>(b)(6)(iii)(A)-(B)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(b)(6)(iv)</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Test Methodology

MIE will report from the event log database tables a series of occurrences that indicates use of the WebChart EHR Data Export Tool:

* Event logs of the report to find all patients for Document Export being called.
* Event logs of CDA documents being generated within a certain short time period following the report.

MIE will track customer reports of data expected to be in mass data export downloads that did not download as failures.

#### Results

Number of times EHR Data Export Tool was used: 0

#### Discussion

We did not have any incidents of clients using the EHR Data Export Tool available at https://github.mieweb.com/webchart/wcexport .  We will be adding some automated tests to test the usage of the export tool during the 2023 calendar year.

### Measure 19: CDA Validation

#### Description

This measure will verify that CDAs both created by and received by a Webchart EHR system pass basic CDA validation.

#### Associated Certification Criteria

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Certification Criteria</strong></td>
<td><strong>Requirement(s)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>‘‘Transitions of care" (§ 170.315(b)(1) Cures Update)</td>
<td>(b)(1)(ii)(A)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"Data export" (§ 170.315(b)(6))</td>
<td>(b)(6)(ii), (A)-(F)</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Test Methodology

All CDAs stored within a Webchart EHR will be run through schema validation regardless of the document's origin.  Documents may originate within the WebChart EHR system or be imported from a third party application of manual upload.  The schema validator will be installed within the MIE production environment to ensure the security of all PHI contained in the documents.  Only results of the validation will be made available, document content will not be revealed to developers during testing.

The number of valid vs. invalid CDAs and their sources will be reported.

#### Results

All CDAs
<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>CDA Documents Marked Valid in Period</strong></td>
<td>2628</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>CDA Documents Marked Invalid in Period</strong></td>
<td>1589</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>26</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>CDA Documents Marked Invalid in Period</strong></td>
<td>39</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>% Marked Invalid In Period</strong></td>
<td>60%</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Discussion

The high percentage of invalid validation documents were caused by a few factors.   From the majority of CDAs that came from outside 3rd party vendors, these were issues with the content that they sent in.  We have been working with these vendors to establish getting alerts to them when CDAs are not passing validation, and we expect to see improvements in those numbers in 2023.  For the Webchart generated documents, the documents generated were low, and mostly generated manually.  The issues seen were from workflow issues within various systems that generated missing data.  We've improved the CCDA generation throughout the year to display the data properly for validation when missing.  We are also anticipating more automated CCDA generation being implemented as part of workflows in 2023.

It should also be noted that none of the invalid documents caused any noted problems for viewing or ingesting documents during the year.  The errors were of a nature such as "non-conformant" empty fields in attributes that did not cause any issues with viewing/importing data.

### Measure 20: Patient Data requests VIA API

#### Description

This measure will verify that the API as outlined in WebChart EHR's documentation is functional. A valid request for patient information must provide that information.

#### Associated Certification Criteria

</tr>
<tr>
<td>(g)(9)(i)(B) - Data Return</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Test Methodology

To address the overall automated testing, the following test requests will be made daily against a test system in a production environment.

* Issue a request in the browser to search for a patient (patient selection)
* Issue a request in the browser to request demographics of a patient (data category request)
* Issue a request using the export tool described in the documentation.

All API requests made in production systems are recorded in log files.  The number of requests logged will be reported against the number of issues with API functionality that are reported.

#### Results

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Production Exports</strong></td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Total Charts Exported</strong></td>
<td>167268</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Total Export Errors</strong></td>
<td>26</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Discussion

As expected, the production use of the API was rare, but the total number of export errors was minimal.  Patient chart exports were successful in 99.9% of cases.

### Measure 21: Web Content Accessibility

#### Description

This measure will verify that all certified content in the patient portal will maintain accessibility conformance as outlined in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0.

#### Associated Certification Criteria

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Certification Criteria</strong></td>
<td><strong>Requirement(s)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://www.healthit.gov/test-method/view-download-and-transmit-3rd-party#test_procedure"></a></td>
<td>(e)(1)(i) - Web Content Accessibility</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Test Methodology

MIE will conduct monthly third-party production accessibility scanning as well as automated nightly internal accessibility scanning of a test system in a production environment.

#### Results

The internal accessibility scanning of a pre-production test system identified 0 urgent and 0 secondary non-conformance issues in 98.79% of nightly and ad-hoc scans throughout the year.  In the remaining 1.21% of scans only secondary issues were uncovered, all of which were eliminated prior to code changes reaching production systems.  Production accessibility scanning identified 0 urgent and 0 secondary non-conformance issues for the entire quarter.

#### Discussion

As expected no urgent non-conformance issues were identified in either live production or pre-production test systems.  In the rare occurrence that a secondary non-conformance issue was identified in testing, it was addressed and eliminated prior to reaching live production systems.
