<td>WebChart EHR 7.4 was the primary product version available to customers in 2022 and all data collected during the first three quarters was collected exclusively in v7.4.  Customers began transitioning to WebChart EHR 8.4 during the fourth quarter.  Data collected in Q4 represents a combination of data from v7.4 and v8.4.  Customers continue to use the same technology (database, log files, etc) after transition to v8.4, so there is no interruption to RWT data collection activities.</td>

## Summary of Testing Methods and Key Findings  
  
WebChart EHR is a cloud-based, fully-inclusive EHR solution.  All certified functionality is delivered in all instances of the product regardless of the care setting, size of practice, or required use cases for a given practice.  Each production client is maintained in a separate database; however, the implementation of the environment is identical with the exception of optional increased security protocols that a client may choose to add for enhanced data protection. Additionally, the only differences between the client-facing portion of each system are a result of configuration settings that can be selected at go-live or updated at any time during a client's contract.  Due to this philosophy of product delivery, all certified capabilities may not be actively used in all marketed care settings or may not be actively used in any current client production system.  To address the Real World Testing requirements, MIE will be using a hybrid approach.  Testing will primarily be conducted using de-identified real patient data from production systems as recorded in database tables and log files.  For those criteria for which this live production recording is not available or minimal due to lack of client usage, client reported issues will be tracked and reported in addition to enacting automated tests of the certified functionality in a test system in a production environment.  The automated tests will be run daily or weekly as appropriate in a system that is identical in substance and delivery to a client production system with the only exception being live real patient data.  This blended approach will allow MIE to prove ongoing maintenance of WebChart EHR's certified technology regardless of the level of implementation by current clients.

  
## Measures Used in Overall Approach  
  
The following measures first summarize the testing methods and justification used for testing each criteria requirement during the 2022 testing period.  The real world testing results collected throughout 2022 and a discussion of those results then follow.  Please review the Criteria-Measure Matrix above to review which measure(s) will cover a specific requirement.
  
### Measure 1: Clinical Quality Measures Outgoing  

  
#### Description  
  
This measure will review WebChart EHR's ability to measure clinical quality and export the required information.  Compliance will be tested both manually by developers and clients as well as automatically by reporting bodies and the Cypress CUV+ test system.
  
#### Associated Certification Criteria

<tr>

<td>(c )(3)(i) - Report</td>
</tr>

</table>

  
#### Test Methodology  
  
First, MIE will install an instance of Cypress 6+ on our production servers following all of our protocols for maintaining the security of PHI.  Cypress CUV+ supports the validation of QRDA reports containing PHI and will be used monthly to validate a random selection of QRDAs from the care settings identified.  Any errors identified by Cypress CUV+ will be tracked, reported, and addressed, then followed with testing of a larger sample of files.  
Additionally, WebChart EHR has two customers that participate in quarterly attestations using both QRDA I and QRDA III reports.  These customers regularly inspect their CQM compliance numbers and will alert MIE to any perceived errors.  MIE will then collect and track the attestation results from the reporting bodies including any errors so as to report a success/failure rate.

  
#### Results

</table>

  
#### Discussion  
  
As expected, no errors were found in formatting or coding of the certified measures.  One warning was reported by a client where a provider NPI was included in the QRDA III file, but the provider had been removed from the client reported roster.  The provider producing the warning departed the practice mid-year causing data to be tracked in WebChart EHR for encounters that the provider performed prior to their departure.  This warning was determined to be of no impact to the eCQM certified functionality. Additionally, one QRDA III error was reported by a client where the performance rate was calculated without removing the exclusions from the denominator prior to calculation; however, since the error occurred on a non-certified measure, this error was determined to be of no impact to the certified eCQM functionality.   
  
### Measure 2: Clinical Quality Measures Incoming  

  
#### Description  
  
This measure will review WebChart EHR's ability to measure clinical quality and export the required information.  Compliance will be tested both manually by developers and clients as well as automatically by reporting bodies and the Cypress CUV+ test system.
  
#### Associated Certification Criteria

<tr>
<td>"CQMs – report" (§170.315(c)(3))</td>
<td>(c )(3)(i) - Report</td>
</tr>

</table>
  
#### Test Methodology  
  
MIE will install an instance of Cypress 6+ on our production servers following all of our protocols for maintaining the security of PHI.  Automated testing will download QRDA I files from Cypress for each certified CQM, import the files to WebChart EHR, calculate the CQMs, and export the QRDA files for Cypress validation of both the content and calculations to verify that the import was successful.  Any errors identified by Cypress will be tracked, reported, and addressed.

### Measure 3: E-Prescribing Messages Sent and Received  

  
#### Description  
  
This measure will verify that all supported e-prescribing message types are in use in WebChart EHR, including inbound and outbound message types.
  
#### Associated Certification Criteria  


<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Certification Criteria</strong></td>

</tr>

</table>

  
#### Test Methodology  
  
MIE will report on the number of CDA formatted documents reconciled via the "Froozhie" tool.  
Following each reconcile, a temporary CDA for the chart will be created and validated to ensure the reconciled data can be incorporated into a CDA created free of schematic errors (the CDA document will *NOT* be kept, only the result of the validation).  Additionally, any client complaints that data is not being imported correctly from the tool will be tracked, investigated, and reported
  
#### Results

Only results of the validation will be made available, document content will not be revealed to developers during testing.

The number of valid vs. invalid CDAs and their sources will be reported.

#### Discussion  
  
Add a brief summary of how data changed across quarters.  Discuss causes of unexpected results on the year, lessons learned, and what we plan to do differently during 2023 to improve testing and client experience
  
### Measure 20: Patient Data requests VIA API  

  
#### Description  
  
This measure will verify that the API as outlined in WebChart EHR's documentation is functional. A valid request for patient information must provide that information.
  
#### Associated Certification Criteria  


<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Certification Criteria</strong></td>
<td><strong>Requirement(s)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"Application access – patient selection" (§ 170.315(g)(7))</td>
<td>(g)(7)(i) - Query processing and response</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"Application access – data category request" (§ 170.315(g)(8))</td>
<td>(g)(8)(i)(A) - Return CCDS data</td>

</table>
  
#### Test Methodology  
  
To address the overall automated testing, the following test requests will be made daily against a test system in a production environment.
* Issue a request in the browser to search for a patient (patient selection)
* Issue a request in the browser to request demographics of a patient (data category request)
* Issue a request using the export tool described in the documentation.
All API requests made in production systems are recorded in log files.  The number of requests logged will be reported against the number of issues with API functionality that are reported.
  
#### Results

</table>
  
#### Discussion  
  
As expected, the production use of the API was rare, but the total number of export errors was minimal.  Patient chart exports were successful in XX% of cases.  Add a brief summary of how data changed across quarters.
  
### Measure 21: Web Content Accessibility  

  
#### Description  
  
This measure will verify that all certified content in the patient portal will maintain accessibility conformance as outlined in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0.
  
#### Associated Certification Criteria  


<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Certification Criteria</strong></td>
<td><strong>Requirement(s)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://www.healthit.gov/test-method/view-download-and-transmit-3rd-party#test_procedure"></a></td>
<td>(e)(1)(i) - Web Content Accessibility</td>
</tr>

</table>
  
#### Test Methodology  
  
MIE will conduct monthly third-party production accessibility scanning as well as automated nightly internal accessibility scanning of a test system in a production environment.
  
#### Results  
  
The internal accessibility scanning of a pre-production test system identified 0 urgent and 0 secondary non-conformance issues in 98.79% of nightly and ad-hoc scans throughout the year.  In the remaining 1.21% of scans only secondary issues were uncovered, all of which were eliminated prior to code changes reaching production systems.  Production accessibility scanning identified 0 urgent and 0 secondary non-conformance issues for the entire quarter.
  
#### Discussion  
  
As expected no urgent non-conformance issues were identified in either live production or pre-production test systems.  In the rare occurrence that a secondary non-conformance issue was identified in testing, it was addressed and eliminated prior to reaching live production systems.
