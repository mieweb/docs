# Justification for Real World Testing Approach  
  
WebChart EHR is a cloud-based, fully-inclusive EHR solution.  All certified functionality is delivered in all instances of the product regardless of the care setting, size of practice, or required use cases for a given practice.  Each production client is maintained in a separate database; however, the implementation of the environment is identical with the exception of optional increased security protocols that a client may choose to add for enhanced data protection. Additionally, the only differences between the client-facing portion of each system are a result of configuration settings that can be selected at go-live or updated at any time during a client's contract.  Due to this philosophy of product delivery, all certified capabilities may not be actively used in all marketed care settings or may not be actively used in any current client production system.  To address the Real World Testing requirements, MIE will be using a hybrid approach.  Testing will primarily be conducted using de-identified real patient data from production systems as recorded in database tables and log files.  For those criteria for which this live production recording is not available or minimal due to lack of client usage, client reported issues will be tracked and reported in addition to enacting automated tests of the certified functionality in a test system in a production environment.  The automated tests will be run daily or weekly as appropriate in a system that is identical in substance and delivery to a client production system with the only exception being live real patient data.  This blended approach will allow MIE to prove ongoing maintenance of WebChart EHR's certified technology regardless of the level of implementation by current clients.
  
# Measures Used in Overall Approach  
  
The following measures outline and justify how each requirement of all criteria to which WebChart EHR is certified will be tested during the 2022 Real World Testing year.  Please review the Criteria-Measure Matrix above to review which measure(s) will cover a specific requirement.

  
## Measure 1: Clinical Quality Measures Outgoing  

  
### Description  
  
This measure will review WebChart EHR's ability to measure clinical quality and export the required information.  Compliance will be tested both manually by developers and clients as well as automatically by reporting bodies and the Cypress CUV+ test system.
  
### Associated Certification Criteria  


<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Certification Criteria</strong></td>
<td><strong>Requirement(s)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"CQMs – record and export" (§170.315(c)(1))</td>
<td>(c )(1)(i) - Record</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(c )(1)(ii) - Export</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"CQMs – import and calculate" (§170.315(c)(2))</td>
<td>(c )(2)(ii) - Calculate</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"CQMs – report" (§170.315(c)(3))</td>
<td>(c )(3)(i) - Report</td>
</tr>

</table>

  
### Test Methodology  
  
First, MIE will install an instance of Cypress 6+ on our production servers following all of our protocols for maintaining the security of PHI.  Cypress CUV+ supports the validation of QRDA reports containing PHI and will be used monthly to validate a random selection of QRDAs from the care settings identified.  Any errors identified by Cypress CUV+ will be tracked, reported, and addressed, then followed with testing of a larger sample of files.  
Additionally, WebChart EHR has two customers that participate in quarterly attestations using both QRDA I and QRDA III reports.  These customers regularly inspect their CQM compliance numbers and will alert MIE to any perceived errors.  MIE will then collect and track the attestation results from the reporting bodies including any errors so as to report a success/failure rate.

  
### Results  


<table>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><strong>Calculations</strong></td>
<td><strong>QRDA I</strong></td>
<td><strong>QRDA III</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Client Reported Issues</strong></td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1 error in non-certified measure</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Submitted Files</strong></td>
<td>N/A</td>
<td>2820</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Submission Errors</strong></td>

<td>12</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Testing Errors</strong></td>
<td>N/A</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>

</table>

  
### Discussion  
  
As expected, no errors were found in formatting or coding of the certified measures.  One QRDA III error was reported by a client where the performance rate was calculated without removing the exclusions from the denominator prior to calculation; however, since the error occurred on a non-certified measure, this error was determined to be of no impact to the eCQM certified functionality. 

  
## Measure 2: Clinical Quality Measures Incoming  

  
### Description  
  
This measure will review WebChart EHR's ability to measure clinical quality and export the required information.  Compliance will be tested both manually by developers and clients as well as automatically by reporting bodies and the Cypress CUV+ test system.
  
### Associated Certification Criteria  


<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Certification Criteria</strong></td>
<td><strong>Requirement(s)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"CQMs – import and calculate" (§170.315(c)(2))</td>
<td>(c )(2)(i) - Import</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(c )(2)(ii) - Calculate</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"CQMs – report" (§170.315(c)(3))</td>
<td>(c )(3)(i) - Report</td>
</tr>

</table>
  
### Test Methodology  
  
MIE will install an instance of Cypress 6+ on our production servers following all of our protocols for maintaining the security of PHI.  Automated testing will download QRDA I files from Cypress for each certified CQM, import the files to WebChart EHR, calculate the CQMs, and export the QRDA files for Cypress validation of both the content and calculations to verify that the import was successful.  Any errors identified by Cypress will be tracked, reported, and addressed.
  
### Results

</tr>

</table>

  
### Discussion  
  
As expected, no errors were found in formatting or coding of the certified measures.

  
## Measure 3: E-Prescribing Messages Sent and Received  

  
### Description  
  
This measure will verify that all supported e-prescribing message types are in use in WebChart EHR, including inbound and outbound message types.
  
### Associated Certification Criteria  


<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Certification Criteria</strong></td>
<td><strong>Requirement(s)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"Electronic prescribing" (§170.315(b)(3))</td>
<td>(b)(3)(ii)(A)(1) - NewRx</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>(b)(3)(ii)(A)(8) - Error</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(b)(3)(ii)(A)(9) - Verify</td>
</tr>

</table>


  
### Test Methodology  
  
MIE will report a count of messages for each supported message type:
* NewRx
* RxChangeRequest
* RxChangeResponse
* CancelRx
* CancelRxResponse
* RxRenewalRequest
* RxRenewalResponse
* RxFill
* RxHistoryRequest
* RxHistoryResponse
* Status
* Error
* Verify
The report will also include a count of outbound messages unable to be transmitted due to connectivity issues or other errors, for each message type. This report will be based on the contents of each client's local database table of stored messages. MIE will run the report for each client under consideration and aggregate the results.

</table>

Total error rate: 1152/529273*100 = 0.22%
  
### Discussion  
  
As expected, all supported message types have a greater than zero total message count, and the total number of messages far exceeds the number of errored messages with a total error rate of 0.22%.  This represents a decrease in both the total number of errored messages and the overall error rate from Q1.  Additionally, the number of NewRx messages is significantly greater than the number of RxChangeResponse, CancelRx, and RxRenewalResponse messages.


  
## Measure 4: E-Prescribing Diagnosis Codes  

  
### Description  
  
This measure will verify that all diagnosis elements are present in some e-prescribing messages as required by §170.315(b)(3), including inbound and outbound message types.
  
### Associated Certification Criteria  


<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Certification Criteria</strong></td>
<td><strong>Requirement(s)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"Electronic prescribing" (§170.315(b)(3))</td>
<td>(b)(3)(ii)(C)(1) - Primary/Secondary Diagnosis</td>
</tr>

</table>
  
### Test Methodology  
  
MIE will report the contents of each stored message in a client's local database table of stored messages, and counts the inbound and outbound messages that include Diagnosis elements. MIE will run the report for each client under consideration and aggregate the results.
  
### Results  


<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Total NewRx Messages</strong></td>
<td><strong>NewRx Messages with Diagnosis Included</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110204</td>
<td>31531</td>
</tr>

</table>

  
### Discussion  
  
Since the Diagnosis elements are not a required component of a NewRx message, as anticipated, only a subset (28.61%) of the NewRx messages included a diagnosis; however, this is an increase in diagnosis usage over the 26.53% of Q1.

  
## Measure 5: E-Prescribing Oral Liquid Units  

  
### Description  
  
This measure will verify that prescriptions for medications with an oral liquid form will have a quantity unit of measurement of mL, not cc or English units as outlined in §170.315(b)(3).
  
### Associated Certification Criteria  


<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Certification Criteria</strong></td>
<td><strong>Requirement(s)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"Electronic prescribing" (§170.315(b)(3))</td>
<td>(b)(3)(ii)(E) - Metric Units</td>
</tr>

</table>
  
### Test Methodology  
  
MIE will create a system report that examines the contents of each stored NewRx message in a client's local database table of stored messages, limiting to oral liquid medications, and provides a count of each distinct quantity unit of measure used. MIE will run the report for each client under consideration and aggregate the results.
  
### Results

[Units of Presentation](https://www.fda.gov/industry/structured-product-labeling-resources/units-presentation)
  
### Discussion  
  
As expected, C28254 (milliliters) is the most commonly sent unit of measure for oral liquid medications.  Non-C28254 units were only sent in 0.38% of oral liquid medication messages.  This represents a decrease in incorrect code usage from Q1.

  
## Measure 6: E-Prescribing Decimal Format  

  
### Description  
  
This measure will verify that numeric amounts in prescriptions include leading zeros before decimal points and do not allow trailing zeros after a decimal point.
  
### Associated Certification Criteria  


<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Certification Criteria</strong></td>
<td><strong>Requirement(s)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"Electronic prescribing" (§170.315(b)(3))</td>
<td>(b)(3)(ii)(F) - Decimal Format</td>
</tr>

</table>
  
### Test Methodology  
  
MIE will create a system report that examines the contents of each stored NewRx message in a client's local database table of stored messages, and provides a count of prescription messages that include inappropriate trailing zeros, and a count of those missing leading zeros. MIE will run the report for each client under consideration and aggregate the results.
  
### Results  


<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Total NewRx Messages</strong></td>
<td><strong>NewRx Messages with Improper Decimal Format</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110204</td>
<td>399</td>
</tr>

</table>

  
### Discussion  
  
As expected, the number of NewRx messages sent with inappropriate trailing zeros, or missing leading zeros, occurs rarely in only 0.36% of messages; however, this represents an increase from Q1 which indicates the need for either the need for client education or coded validation in the software.

  
## Measure 7: CDA Download  

  
### Description  
  
This measure will verify that the system can accept a CDA document uploaded into the system, assign it to the appropriate chart in the system as appropriate, and display the document with a standard stylesheet with all sections being accepted and visible.
  
### Associated Certification Criteria  


<table>

<td>(b)(1)(ii) - All paragraphs </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(b)(1)(iii) - All paragraphs</td>
</tr>

</table>
  
### Test Methodology  
  
MIE will report on the number of CDA formatted documents uploaded into tracked Webchart systems and the number of upload attempts that failed as stored in client databases and error log files.  
MIE will report on the number of requests to view a CDA document within the system, and the number of times it displayed correctly, and when there were errors in display.  
Any errors reported by customers or the recipients of their quarterly attestations will be tracked and reported as a baseline.  These test assumptions for customer reporting align with the "visual inspection" aspects of the test lab tests.

  
### Results  


<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Total CDA Documents Uploaded</strong></td>

</tr>

</table>
  
### Discussion  
  
As anticipated, there were no errors in being able to upload and view valid CCDA documents.  The number of document views has increased from Q1 to Q2.



  
## Measure 8: Application Access Documentation  

  
### Description  
  
This measure will verify that WebChart EHR's API documentation is publicly and perpetually available.  Compliance will be recorded by an external uptime monitor and reported quarterly.

### Test Methodology  
  
An external uptime monitor will check the availability of all documentation available at [https://docs.webchartnow.com/resources/system-specifications/application-programming-interface-api.html](https://docs.webchartnow.com/resources/system-specifications/application-programming-interface-api.html).  Both up- and downtime will be logged to be reported quarterly.  The cause of any downtime and the duration will also be logged   In the event of any downtime, the amount of downtime can be reported at daily, weekly, or monthly intervals in addition to the quarterly reports, and the cause of each downtime occurrence will be reported.
  
### Results  
  
The MIE API documentation was available 100% of Q2.  
  
### Discussion  
  
As expected, the documentation maintained an uptime of greater than 99.9% at 100% for the quarter.  There was no downtime of any kind this quarter..

  
## Measure 9: Clinical Information Reconciliation and Incorporation  

  
### Description  
  
This measure will verify that the system can take a CCDA transition of care/referral summary formatted according to the standards adopted §170.205(a)(3) and §170.205(a)(4) and read the data for medications, allergies, and conditions from the document, reconcile those into the chart, and that the data is fully incorporated into the chart.

</tr>
<tr>
<td>(b)(2)(iv) - System Verification</td>
</tr>

</table>

  
### Test Methodology  
  
MIE will report on the number of CDA formatted documents reconciled via the "Froozhie" tool.  
Following each reconcile, a temporary CDA for the chart will be created and validated to ensure the reconciled data can be incorporated into a CDA created free of schematic errors (the CDA document will *NOT* be kept, only the result of the validation).  Additionally, any client complaints that data is not being imported correctly from the tool will be tracked, investigated, and reported
  
### Results  


<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>CDA Documents Reconciled</strong></td>
<td>546</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>CDA Documents Generated on a Chart  after a Reconcile that had an invalid Validation</strong></td>
<td>61</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Client reported Issues with CDA reconciliation</strong></td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>

</table>

  
### Discussion  
  
The use of CDA reconciliation in systems was relatively low (although higher than Q1), and no issues with the reconciliation of the documents were reported.

The number of invalid validations were higher than anticipated.  Work is being done to rectify the issues with the CDA generation in these systems, and to put in place a more immediate notification process when invalid CDAs are generated.

  
## Measure 10: Transmission to Immunization Registry: Create Content  

  
### Description  
  
This measure will verify that the system can generate a VXU conforming to the HL7 v2.5.1 standard, CDC guidance for communication to Immunization Registries and state/local guidance. The VXU messages shall contain information related to the demographics and vaccination administration record.

The schema validator will be installed within the MIE production environment to ensure the security of all PHI contained in the documents.  Only results of the validation will be made available, document content will not be revealed to developers during testing.

The number of valid vs. invalid CDAs and their sources will be reported.
  
### Results  


<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>CDA Documents Marked Valid in Period</strong></td>
<td>237</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>CDA Documents Marked Invalid in Period</strong></td>
<td>646</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>% Marked Invalid In Period</strong></td>
<td>73</td>
</tr>

</table>
  
### Discussion  
  
The % marked invalid was extremely high this period.  As stated in Measure 9, "Work is being done to rectify the issues with the CDA generation in these systems, and to put in place a more immediate notification process when invalid CDAs are generated."
  
## Measure 20: Patient Data requests VIA API  

  
### Description  
  
This measure will verify that the API as outlined in WebChart EHR's documentation is functional. A valid request for patient information must provide that information.

### Test Methodology  
  
To address the overall automated testing, the following test requests will be made daily against a test system in a production environment.
* Issue a request in the browser to search for a patient (patient selection)
* Issue a request in the browser to request demographics of a patient (data category request)
* Issue a request using the export tool described in the documentation.
All API requests made in production systems are recorded in log files.  The number of requests logged will be reported against the number of issues with API functionality that are reported.

### Discussion  
  
There was no production use of the API this quarter.
  
## Measure 21: Web Content Accessibility  

  
### Description  
  
This measure will verify that all certified content in the patient portal will maintain accessibility conformance as outlined in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0.
  
### Associated Certification Criteria  


<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Certification Criteria</strong></td>
<td><strong>Requirement(s)</strong></td>

<td>(e)(1)(i) - Web Content Accessibility</td>
</tr>

</table>
  
### Test Methodology  
  
MIE will conduct monthly third-party production accessibility scanning as well as automated nightly internal accessibility scanning of a test system in a production environment.
  
### Results  
  
The internal accessibility scanning of a pre-production test system identified 0 urgent and 0 secondary non-conformance issues in 97.86% of nightly and ad-hoc scans.  In the remaining 2.14% of scans only secondary issues were uncovered, all of which were eliminated prior to code changes reaching production systems.  Production accessibility scanning identified 0 urgent and 0 secondary non-conformance issues for the entire quarter.
  
### Discussion  
  
As expected no urgent non-conformance issues were identified in either live production or pre-production test systems.  In the rare occurrence that a secondary non-conformance issue was identified in testing, it was addressed and eliminated prior to reaching live production systems.
