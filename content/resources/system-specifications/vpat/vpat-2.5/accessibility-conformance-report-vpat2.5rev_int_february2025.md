**Notes:**

This Accessibility Conformance Report reflects the current status of conformance for WebChart EHR / Enterprise Health EHR as evaluated against the applicable accessibility standards, including WCAG 2.1 and EN 301 549. The evaluation covers core functionality available through supported web browsers.

Custom configurations, third-party integrations, and user-generated content may impact accessibility and are not fully addressed in this report. Medical Informatics Engineering is committed to continuous improvement of product accessibility and will provide updated conformance reports upon significant changes or new releases.

For additional information or accessibility support, please contact us using the details provided above.

**Evaluation Methods Used:**

Medical Informatics Engineering conducted this accessibility evaluation using a combination of automated testing, manual inspection, and assistive technology testing. The evaluation was performed against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level A and AA success criteria, as well as applicable clauses of EN 301 549.

The assessment included:

*Automated testing using Axe to identify common accessibility issues
*Manual keyboard-only navigation testing
*Screen reader compatibility testing using NVDA and JAWS
*Visual inspection to verify semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, color contrast, and content structure
*Functional testing in supported web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Edge

This evaluation reflects the accessibility of the default configuration of WebChart EHR / Enterprise Health EHR in a representative usage environment.


Conformance Language and Terminology Clarification:


To ensure consistency, Medical Informatics Engineering is standardizing its use of conformance terms such as "Supports with Exceptions" and "Partially Supports." These terms are now applied more precisely to align with ITI VPAT 2.5Rev guidance and avoid ambiguity in borderline cases (e.g., between functional limitations vs. minor known defects).


Additionally, ongoing efforts are in place to ensure that Section 508 and EN 301 549 clauses are cross-referenced consistently with relevant WCAG Success Criteria throughout the report, enhancing traceability and clarity for evaluators.

<td>The WebChart Patient Portal provides alternative text for most informative non-text content, including icons, buttons, and illustrative images used throughout the application and documentation. Complex graphics (e.g., charts or infographics) include accompanying descriptions or are linked to explanatory content.<br />
<br />
However, occasional decorative images or legacy elements may lack appropriate alternative text. These instances do not convey meaningful information and are generally marked appropriately for assistive technologies to ignore. Continuous audits are in place to enhance coverage and ensure all meaningful non-text content is accessible.</td>

<td>SUPPORTS</td>
<td>The WebChart Patient Portal generally avoids the use of standalone audio-only or video-only prerecorded content. When such content is provided, it is accompanied by appropriate alternatives—such as transcripts for audio-only or descriptive text for video-only presentations. However, certain legacy or third-party media may not yet include complete alternatives.<br />
<br />
Efforts are ongoing to review and remediate such media to ensure compliance. All newly developed media content includes required alternatives at the time of publication.</td>

<td>Supports with Exceptions</td>
<td>The WebChart Patient Portal provides captions for essential prerecorded instructional and support videos when available. However, not all prerecorded media—particularly older support materials or third-party videos—include synchronized captions. For the best user experience and accessibility, captions will be added to remaining legacy content in upcoming accessibility-focused updates. All new media is produced with captioning standards in mind.<br />
<br />
We recommend users consult alternative formats (e.g., transcripts or help articles) when captions are unavailable.</td>

<td>Supports with Exceptions</td>
<td>The WebChart Patient Portal includes limited use of prerecorded multimedia content. For multimedia content that is essential to the clinical or user workflow, text-based alternatives such as transcripts are provided. However, audio descriptions are not consistently available for all prerecorded synchronized media, which may limit accessibility for users who rely on visual content descriptions. Support documentation and help videos may not all have media alternatives at this time.<br />
<br />
Future updates aim to improve conformance by integrating audio descriptions or equivalent alternatives for all prerecorded multimedia content as part of our accessibility roadmap.</td>

Where keyboard shortcuts are used—for example, within administrative or documentation tools—they are either:<br />
<br />
Modifier-key dependent (e.g., Ctrl+ or Alt+ combinations),<br />
Remappable, or<br />

<br />
Simplified summaries at the beginning of complex forms or workflows (e.g., clinical data entry).<br />
<br />
Step indicators for multi-stage processes to support task orientation.<br />
