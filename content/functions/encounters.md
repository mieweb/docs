The {{% system-name %}} system creates customized, programmable encounter forms, with important demographic and clinical data presenting to the clinician at the point-of-care, facilitating more comprehensive encounter documentation. With the {{% system-name %}} Dynamic Encounter, data is easily captured at the time of the visit, allowing clinical staff and providers to streamline all necessary clinic operations.
  
## [TeleHealth](encounters/telehealth.md)  
  
We have worked around the clock to rapidly add telehealth capability to the {{%system-name %}} system, including audio and video capabilities that make it easy for clinicians and patients to conduct a virtual visit. Patients can join a video visit from a portal branded to the clinic or practice; they can do so from a computer equipped with a camera or on a smartphone or mobile device. Clinicians can initiate or join a telehealth visit from the {{% system-name %}} application, and document the visit as it occurs.
  
## [Dictation & Transcription](encounters/dictation-and-transcription.md)  
  
{{% system-name %}} has seamlessly integrated dictation into the workflow to provide the clinician a variety of input methods. As important as dictation is to the daily workflow of the physician, it is equally important to have a streamlined process to have those dictation files converted to text. {{% system-name %}} also includes a robust transcription module for this reason.
  
## [Injury Care](injury-care.md)  
  
{{% system-name %}} can be used for treating, documenting, managing, and reporting injuries and illnesses, which can be initiated from a visit to the clinic, or in advance, via an employee portal. This allows incidents to be reported anytime, day or night. And regardless of how the information is captured, {{% system-name %}} can compile the recorded data into form overlays, minimizing the need for redundant data entry, while also easing reporting burdens.
  
## [Work-Related Exams](encounters/work-related-exams.md)  
  
{{% system-name %}} offers various work-related encounters, which help with managing applicants and pre-placements, as well as examining and documenting fitness, wellness, and one's certification.
