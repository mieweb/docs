Some workflows require to document and identify what TPA (Third Party Administrator) a case/incident should be sent to.  Some systems have a work comp interface for this automatic sending, but now this Claims Report gives a system the ability to report out the same data that a work comp interface would.  The report can be downloaded as a CSV format to be able to send to the identified TPA(s) manually.

There was a feature ticket asking for ability to document/designate what TPA a case/incident should be sent to.  Some client systems have a work comp interface for this and have had this field in their case/incident section, but now there is a DIY type of ability to help client systems who may not want to invest in a work comp interface and send the info to their TPA's themselves, etc.
