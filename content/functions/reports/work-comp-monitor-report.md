The Work Comp Monitor Report is for monitoring work comps claims that are sent to TPAs (Third Party Administrators). Examples of TPA's include Sedwick, Origami, LIberty Mutual, CARS, Corvel, Brentwood, Broadspire, Risx-Facs (Gallagher Bassett), Vigilanz, and PMA. This report is used to make sure all work comp claims are successfully processed and sent to the TPA. The report will display any claims pending, errored, processed and sent according to search filter criteria entered.

## Filter Criteria

![](../work-comp-monitor-report.assets/866a81935cbf33635f7322ac3ba2479c.png)

* <strong>Third-Party Administrator (TPA):</strong> This field is required to be selected to run the report.  In almost all cases <em>All</em> will always be used because it's rare for any one system to have multiple TPAs. If additional options are available, they are populated by an observation code with the name <em>Send Claim to TPA</em> in conjunction with the interface installation.
* <strong>Start Date:</strong> The start date field is also required. The start date will begin searching for claims that match the <em>Date Sent (to the TPA)</em>.
* <strong>End Date:</strong> The end date field will stop searching for claims that match the <em>Date Sent (to the TPA)</em>. If no date is entered, the search will continue up to ‘today'.
* <strong>Incident Number:</strong> The incident number is a system generated db id number for the case.
* <strong>Case Number:</strong> The case number is the system generated number and helps to identify or describe the incident.

## DataVis Report Output

After keying in search criteria and hitting the SEARCH button, the results will be displayed in a DataVis format.  The report will display any claims pending, errored, processed and sent according to search filter criteria entered.  For more information on DataVis, please refer to [Using DataVis Grids](using-datavis-grids-data-tools.md).
