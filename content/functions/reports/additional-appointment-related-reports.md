## Appointments Needing Dication Report  
  
The Appointments Needing Dictation report displays a report of appointments that are in the system that don't have dictation done/linked for that appointment date.  
This is an optional list report and can be turned on for your practice.  
It can be shown in the Reports side tab and/or it can be shown in the Omniscope side tab or both.  
There are many options for this report, however the only way to get a patient off this list is to add dictation to the appointment date by clicking the add dictation link in the options column.

Your MIE Implementer can add a programming clause in that layout to exclude appointments that have been cancelled, or are no-show appointments. This will take those patient appointments off this report list or keep those from showing up on this report list.  
MIE can also exclude certain appointment types from this report list as well (ex: your practice never needs dictations done for an appointment type of Injection, so you can have your MIE Implementer program this report list to exclude that appointment type from showing up on this list).  
MIE can also program a date range for this report list. You can show the entire report list, or you can ask for it to be programmed to only show the appointments needing dictation within the last 30 days from today's logged in date or ask it to be programmed to â€˜start' this report list from a certain starting date vs. the entire life of the database, etc.  
Otherwise, once it is on the report list there is no way to get the patient's appointment off this report list unless you upload a dictation on that patient's appointment.
