You must have security role access to the Reports module/tab. This setting is in the Security Role Editor and is in {{% system-name %}} controls called STATISTICS. Set to Yes or No. This allows users within a role to access the entire Reports left-side bar tab (except Tran Stats tab). Also allows users within a role to access the Statistics tab in Control.  
There is a report available to run to see any open encounters for the practice. If you have security rights, you can access this report by going to the Reports sidemenu tab, then click the Visits tab, then find the report named *Encounter Exams-Still Open*.

When you click on the *Encounter Exams-Still Open* report, it will automatically list any and all open encounters for your {{% system-name %}} system. It displays open encounters that have not yet been archived and closed as documents in the system. You can see the patient's name, the encounter visit type, who is set as performing physician, location, date created and the options column.

You can also run other Encounter reports based on specific search criteria you wish by utilizing the other encounter reports found in the Visits report tab.
