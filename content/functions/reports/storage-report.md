You must have security role access to the Reports module/tab. This setting is in the Security Role Editor and is in {{% system-name %}} controls called STATISTICS. Set to Yes or No. This allows users within a role to access the entire Reports left-side bar tab (except Tran Stats tab). Also allows users within a role to access the Statistics tab in Control.  
Storage Report runs a document storage report for DICOM/radiology images that have been pushed to the system.  
Click *Reports* tab on the left sidebar menu.  
Click *Storage Report* tab from the top tab menu.  
The Document Storage Report search screen will open.
