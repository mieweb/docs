You must have security role access to the Reports module/tab. This setting is in the Security Role Editor and is in {{% system-name %}} controls called STATISTICS. Set to Yes or No. This allows users within a role to access the entire Reports tab.

## Prescriptions Printed/Faxed/E-Sent

E-Meds Report displays medications that have been prescribed in {{% system-name %}} (prescribed using e-meds module/tab or encounters plan area) that were printed or faxed or electronically transmitted (e-sent) via SureScripts. This only shows a report of **printed and faxed and e-sent** prescriptions. If a med is prescribed but hasn't been/wasn't printed or faxed, it does not show up on this report.

Click *Reports* tab on the left side-bar menu.

Click the *Medications/Allergies/Scripts* tab from the top tab menu and select *Prescriptions Printed/Faxed/E-Sent* report.

A search engine shows on the screen.
