Users must have security access to be in Health Surveillance Management control tab. On the sidemenu tab, click the CONTROL tab. Once in the Control tab, click the HEALTH SURVEILLANCE tab listed in the menu of tabs (or in your system it may be called Health Surveillance)

From within the Health Surveillance tab found in control, there is a hyperlink to access a *Panel Definition Report*.

Once the *Panel Definition Report* hyperlink has been clicked, it will open a pivotable report version. This report shows all panel actions in a pivot table to help with panel management.

Pivot reports can display the data in various columns/rows and looks/views. Use the drop-downs to select and drag & drop components around to get the view you wish to see and report the data.
