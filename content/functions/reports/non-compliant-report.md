You must have security role access to the Reports module/tab. This setting is in the Security Role Editor and is in {{% system-name %}} controls called STATISTICS. Set to Yes or No. This allows users within a role to access the entire Reports left-side bar tab (except Tran Stats tab). Also allows users within a role to access the Statistics tab in Control.
Non-Compliant Report lists patients that are not taking the proper medications (by drug class) for their condition (ex: CHF patients)
Click *Reports* tab on the left side-bar menu.
