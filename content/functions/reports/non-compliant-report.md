You must have security role access to the Reports module/tab. This setting is in the Security Role Editor and is in {{% system-name %}} controls called STATISTICS. Set to Yes or No. This allows users within a role to access the entire Reports left-side bar tab (except Tran Stats tab). Also allows users within a role to access the Statistics tab in Control.

Non-Compliant Report lists patients that are not taking the proper medications (by drug class) for their condition (ex: CHF patients)

Click *Reports* tab on the left side-bar menu.

Click *Non-Compliant Report* tab from the top tab menu.

The Non-Compliant Patients List Options screen will open.

* <strong>Physician:</strong> Can select all physicians or a specific physician from the drop-down arrow.
* <strong>Evaluation Date:</strong> Select the Evaluation Date. This is for historical purposes.  You can see how the non-compliance percentages change over time.  Usually you will want to use today's date.
* <strong>List Patients:</strong> Checkmark this to show a list of non-compliant patients according to the search. Keep it uncheck-marked to show a compliance report card for the physician(s) you selected.
