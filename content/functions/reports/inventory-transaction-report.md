These are the search and filter field choices currently available. You do not need to enter in every field, but the more fields (filters) you have entered, the more narrowed down your inventory transaction search results will be.

* <strong>Patient Name:</strong> You can type in the specific patient's last name (or beginning portion of a last name) to show results of transactions done for patients with that last name or portion of last name. This is not an auto-complete, but the search will render results based on what you enter here. (Ex, if you just type a Fr, then it will show results for any patients with the last name that begins with an <strong>Fr</strong>). Same applies to the First Name field.
* <strong>Item Name:</strong> You can type in the specific medication item name (or beginning portion of a medication) to show results of transactions done of that medication. This is not an auto-complete, but the search will render results based on what you enter here. (Ex, if you just type a Am, then it will show results for all transactions that begin with an <strong>Am</strong>).
* <strong>Item Class:</strong> Can limit the results of the Transaction Report to a specific drug class selection of medications.
* <strong>Item Manufacturer:</strong> You can type in the specific manufacturer (or beginning portion of a manufacturer) to show results of transactions done with that manufacturer. This is not an auto-complete, but the search will render results based on what you enter here. (Ex, if you just type an S, then it will show results for all transactions that have a manufacturer that begins with an <strong>S</strong>).
* <strong>Item Lot:</strong> You can type in the specific lot # (or beginning number of the lot) to show results of transactions done with that lot number. This is not an auto-complete, but the search will render results based on what you enter here. (Ex, if you just type an 3, then it will show results for all transactions that have a lot number that begins with an <strong>3</strong>).
* <strong>Site/Stockpile:</strong> Can limit the results of the Transaction Report to specific location(s) and/or stockpile(s).
* <strong>UserName:</strong> You can type in the specific user or username (or beginning portion of a username) to limit results to show transactions done by that user (username) and select from the auto-complete. This is the user that performed an inventory transaction. If you need to limit the selections that display here, the Inventory Transaction Report Settings tab (found in Control sidemenu tab) controls this field. From the <em>Inv.Trans.Report Settings</em> tab, select the department(s) in this tab, which will be used to display the usernames in the Inventory Transaction Report. This limits the selection down to just those involved in using or dispensing inventory.

* <strong>Count by:</strong> Check-mark which of these that you wish to show a count for. It will display your results as a count only. This is possibly used to see how many (the count) of transactions by patient, by item or by user.
* <strong>Transaction Types:</strong> All are defaulted to be check-marked to show all in the results search. You can un-checkmark any to leave those types out. These are transaction types for the inventoried medication. You can show inventory transactions that were:
    * <strong>Received:</strong> These are transactions when a user entered an inventory from the add screen.
    * <strong>Dispensed:</strong> These are transactions when a user dispensed inventoried meds from the patient's chart.
    * <strong>Expired</strong>: These are transactions when a user used an expire med option and expired some inventoried meds.
    * <strong>Transferred:</strong> These are transactions when a user used the transfer med option for an inventoried med.
    * <strong>Returned:</strong> These are transactions when a user entered a return into the inventory.
    * <strong>Edited:</strong> These are transactions when a user used options to edit an inventoried med.
    * <strong>Corrected:</strong> This is the transaction when a user changed an inventory item name or sig.
* <strong>Prescriber:</strong> You can limit the report to show results that are limited to a specific Prescriber/user in the system. Select using the auto-complete.
* <strong>RXID:</strong> This is the specific dispense/fill id# that {{% system-name %}} assigns when a medication inventory item is dispensed.
* <strong>Date Range:</strong> Enter a date range to limit the inventory transactions by.
* <strong>Fee Schedule:</strong> Ability to search by fee schedule. If a Fee Schedule is selected, the results will include the cost of the items displayed.

Click the SEARCH button to render your results by your filters (fields) you entered.
