The All Active Deals-Detail Report displays a detailed list of all order items used in Deals. Use the Datavis filters to filter by EO, Order Description, Order Code, Order Charge Code, Deal Charge Code, Deal Price, Standard Price, Price Difference, EncID or Layout name.

**EO**: This column represents the Employer Organization in which this order item has been used.

**Order Description**: This column represent the Order Description as created/entered directly on the Order item (Orders-List Editor)

**Order Code**: This column represent the Order Code as created/entered directly on the Order Item (Orders-List Editor)

**Order Charge Code**: This column represents the Order Billing Code as created/entered directly on the Order Item (Orders-List Editor)
