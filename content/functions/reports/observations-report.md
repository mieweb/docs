You must have security role access to the Reports module/tab. This setting is in the Security Role Editor and is in {{% system-name %}} controls called STATISTICS. Set to Yes or No. This allows users within a role to access the entire Reports left-side bar tab (except Tran Stats tab). Also allows users within a role to access the Statistics tab in Control.

Click *Reports* tab on the left sidebar menu.

Find and click *Patient Observations* link/tab to view report search fields.

You do not have to fill out every single field. These fields are different ways to report stats and each field gets more specific and narrows your search down.

This is a report that you can run to show anything stored as an observation (or encounter data if stored as an observations), vitals, etc. for all patients.

* <strong>Start Date:</strong> This is a required field. You must enter a start date.
* <strong>End Date:</strong> This is a required field. You must have an end date.
* <strong>Observation:</strong> This is a required field. You must enter one observation for the report to run. Type in the first part of the observation you are searching to show results for. The system will attempt to auto-complete and give you a selection of choices. Click on your choice and it will save it in the list. Continue to type and select another observation to add to the search criteria report you want to run.

You can rearrange or sort by clicking the column title.

## Additional Search Criteria

These are optional fields.

* <strong>Entered Date Start/End:</strong> You can enter a date range to show patient observations <em>entered</em> on a specific date range. This is different than the <em>observed</em> date.
* <strong>Entered By:</strong> You can begin typing in the first or last name of a user in your {{% system-name %}} system. It will auto-complete to give you choices. Select the user you wish to narrow down this report by. This will show those patient observations that were entered by that user only.
