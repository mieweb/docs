You must have security role access to the Reports module/tab. This setting is in the Security Role Editor and is in {{% system-name %}} controls called STATISTICS. Set to Yes or No. This allows users within a role to access the entire Reports left-side bar tab (except Tran Stats tab). Also allows users within a role to access the Statistics tab in Control.

Click *Reports* tab on the left sidebar menu.

Click *WebScan* *Reports* tab from the top tab menu. The Search fields will appear on the screen.

You do not have to fill out every single field. These fields are different ways to report stats and each field gets more specific and narrows your search down.

*WebScan* displays scanned/uploaded statistics *and* Indexed statistics in separate categories. This report will display the results of each according to your search engine fields. This report automatically defaults to today's date and shows today's results under this search engine.

If you just *open* this, view the spreadsheet, then click Back arrow to escape back into {{% system-name %}} . You cannot print/save, etc from this *open* view. You have to go back to download csv and select to save it to your computer and then get back into the file you saved to edit/print, etc.

If you *save* this download, it will prompt you to where you want to save the file on your hard-drive, etc. Name your file, and save it, then it will pop you back into the reports tab you were in. You can then find your file/spreadsheet where you saved it and then sort/re-categorize, etc and print. It's just a quick way to save the information in excel spreadsheet format. CSV stands for comma separated values file. Excel opens these formats.
