The Absence Management module allows employees to request a leave of absence or a return to work from a medical absence via the Employee portal.

Clinical/Administrative staff can review/create an encounter to capture information regarding the request, work absence, and plan for return to work.  An encounter is used to track case information, work statuses, lost time, restriction and accommodations until the patient returns to work.
