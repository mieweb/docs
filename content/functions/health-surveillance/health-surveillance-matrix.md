Please review and download the [Health Surveillance Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tOwhUxErru3-fsHKGUES0lVE8tr_p_RaWX8bEruCghQ/edit#gid=516694809). Utilize the descriptions below to address any questions that may arise while assessing the organization's needs and requirements of health surveillance panels.
  
## Panels  


<table>
<tr>
<td>Column</td>
<td>Description</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Panel Full Name</td>
<td>The full name of the panel. The name should always be descriptive and clear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Panel Description</td>
<td>The description of the panel. The description outlines what the panel is for, what population is included, and any helpful information useful for understanding the need for the panel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Source</td>
<td>This field is used to document the regulatory source of the required action(s)/protocol needed to construct the panel. The regulatory source is the group or governing body that has issued a requirement for the necessary action(s) (e.g., OSHA, DOT, Company Policy, etc.). This is a free-text field; however, the system will remember prior sources entered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reference</td>
<td>The reference number or identification code associated with the panel and its source. This field can be left blank or contain any relevant reference identifier (e.g., OSHA Policy #).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Status</td>
<td>The status of the regulation (e.g., Active, Adopted, Inactive, etc.). This is a free-text field; however, the system will remember prior status entries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Open Membership</td>
<td>This determines whether the supervisor can add/remove employees from panels from the portal. Select Open Membership if the panel is to allow any employee to be added by their supervisor as a member of the panel. From the portal, there is a Supervisor Review link. This link only displays for supervisors. The supervisor screen shows only the employees with a reference key for color coding. Also, any Open Membership panels will display here, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Restricted</td>
<td>Utilize this field to restrict access to the panel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Representative Event</td>
<td>A Representative Event is an encounter or procedure that represents the panel as a whole, whenever applicable. From the drop-down, select Encounter or Procedure. Unless the panel is expected to open an encounter when the orders populate the Due List, then the representative event will always be a procedure. Once the event type has been selected, use the next drop-down to select the Encounter Type (encounter) or Order Item (procedure) to be the representative event. The Order Item used for procedure representative events usually bear the same name as the panel it represents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Owner</td>
<td>The name of the user that manages the panel. This user is responsible for overseeing and maintaining all the memberships within the panel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Adjustment Range Early Days</td>
<td>Systems with Forecasting and Due Date Adjustment enabled can use this field to override the default number of Early Days or Late Days for the panel. Leave this field blank to use the default; otherwise, specify a positive number of days to override the default. Specifying zero (0) will disallow shifting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Adjustment Range Late Days</td>
<td>Systems with Forecasting and Due Date Adjustment enabled can use this field to override the default number of Early Days or Late Days for the panel. Leave this field blank to use the default; otherwise, specify a positive number of days to override the default. Specifying zero (0) will disallow shifting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Exit Alert</td>
<td>This provides an alert to notify panel members that there is an exit requirement when exiting the panel (e.g., OSHA Noise, the individual should be offered an exit exam when they no longer fit the criteria for inclusion).</td>
</tr>
