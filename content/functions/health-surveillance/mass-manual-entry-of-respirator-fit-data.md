A mass entry screen to manually key in Respirator Fit Test data for charts is available in 09-2024RC and newer.  It is accessible from the E-Chart sidemenu tab.

The Resp Fit Program mass entry screen method utilizes a configured Menu Item to be in the system for use.  If you would like this mass entry screen method for system use, please contact your Deployment Consultant or our Help Desk.

## Resp Fit Program - Mass Entry Method

Within the E-Chart sidemenu tab, the Resp Fit Program mass entry method screen is available.

### Add Respirator Fit Test data record

Use the Patient search field to select the specific patient/employee chart needing to key in Resp Fit record data for.

At the top of the *Add Respirator Fit* screen, additional chart identifiers are displayed so you can confirm this is indeed the specific chart you wish to key in respirator fit data for.   If it is not, simply click the X to exit the pop-up and start a new patient chart search.

The *Panel Memberships* section identifies any health surveillance panels that the chart is a current member of **or** will display verbiage that the chart is not a member of any panels.

**Mask (this is a required field)**: This is an auto-complete list of choices in your system that is maintained in our auto-complete editor. You can also free text here via the auto-complete field, but if you want reporting to be consistent, please give your pre-defined mask choices to your Deployment Consultant for insertion into this auto-complete choice to pop up by default for your users to select. Simply begin to type in the name of the mask type manufacturer and it will attempt to auto-complete your typing and give you valid choices. You can also hit your ↓ down arrow key on your keyboard to open up the list of choices to select from in this field. When done, use your tab key to advance to the next field.

**NOTE:** your system can be programmed to offer a drop-down of mask choices instead of an auto-complete/free text method. Contact our help desk or Deployment Consultant for that configuration change.

**Size (this is a required field):** Choose the size of the mask using the drop-down of choices. The ‘Universal' option selection means one size fits all.

**Type:** Qualitative or Quantitative if wish to collect that

**Last Fit Test:** Enter in the date of this fit test (typically is today's date as it automatically prefills)

**Last Fit Expires:** will automatically calculate to be 1 year from today's date, but you can change

**Pass/Fail (this is a required field):** Enter in if the employee passed or failed this fit testing

**Final Fit Factor:** Key in if wish to collect that

**Comments:** Add any free-text comments needed

When done keying in the entry, click the SAVE button to store the resp fit data record to the chart.

![](../mass-manual-entry-of-respirator-fit-data.assets/cd44face588dc4632c976748f9421a14.png)

Once saved, the system will display a Successful added record message at the top right corner and it will refresh the screen automatically to allow you to search for a new patient chart to key in respirator fit test data for.

### Successful Saved Record

Once you save/add a respirator fit data record to the chart, a separate document will also be stored in their chart as well as a completed Resp Fit Test order item will be inserted into the chart's due list (effective 09-2024RC).  If the chart had a pending Resp Fit Test due on their due list, the system would mark/insert that one as completed.

The Respirator Fit Test record data will also be visible in the Fit Tests Results portlet of the specific chart, available on reports for the system and for supervisors, and shared to the portal if your system is so configured.

## Editing or Deleting of Respirator Fit Data

Editing or deleting respirator fit test records cannot be done from the manual mass entry method screen.  It must be done individually within the specific accessed patient/employee chart.

There is a separate help guide on the ability to edit or delete respirator fit record data in individual charts using the Resp Info chart tab.  Please see separate guide titled [Respirator Info Chart Tab](respirator-info-chart-tab.md) and also a separate chapter on the below LMS (Learning Management System) course.
