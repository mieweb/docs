Users must also have permission to the EO partition. Users who are restricted from the system's EO partition, will not be able to add contacts to EO charts.

Select the **Add New** button when all known information regarding the contact has been entered.

The user is redirected to the *Overview (Contact)* tab in the Contact chart. The Contact chart displays contact information and the organizations associated with the contact. Users can return to the Employer Organization by clicking on the employer organization name under the *Organization* section.
