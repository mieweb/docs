1. Navigate to the <em>Employer Organizations</em> tab in the <em>Control Panel</em>. Before adding a new employer organization, use the <strong>Search</strong> option to ensure the employer organization you need to create is not already in the system.

4. Users will be redirected to the newly created employer organization chart and land on the <em>Overview (EO)</em> tab. Notice an <em>Account</em> is also created and linked to the employer organization by default. This feature is used for customers utilizing the Financials module, Deals and/or a billing interface. If desired, customers not utilizing any of these features, can turn off the auto creation of Accounts from the system setting <strong>WebChart/Settings/Create Account when registering Employer Organization</strong>.

5. In the <em>Employer Organization</em> section, select the <strong>Edit/Pencil icon</strong>. Enter the <strong>Partition</strong> to be utilized by this employer organization and any other known information, then click the <strong>Save</strong> button.

6. If known, add contacts to the employer organization. Click the <strong>Edit/Pencil Icon</strong> on the <em>Contacts</em> section to search for existing contacts to the employer organization. If the contact does not already exist, click the <strong>Add New Contact</strong> link to create a new contact. See more information on [Adding contacts](adding-contacts-to-employer-organizations.md).

7. In most cases, the <em>Account</em> will automatically be created when the employer organization is created.  Accounts are used for customers utilizing the Financials module, Deals and/or a billing interface. Customers not utilizing any of these features, can turn off the auto creation of Accounts from the system setting <strong>WebChart/Settings/Create Account when registering Employer Organization</strong>. However, if not using these modules, it does not cause any harm to create Accounts, so customers do not need to turn this setting off unless they specifically have reason to. See [Creating and adding accounts](creating-and-adding-accounts-to-employer-organizations.md) for more information on adding accounts.

9. To add a <em>Sub-Employer Organization</em> to the current employer organization, select the <strong>Edit/Pencil Icon</strong> on the <em>Sub-Employer Organization</em> section. Use the <strong>Name</strong> autocomplete to search for the Sub-Employer Organization (Sub-EO). If the employer organization does not exist, click the <strong>Add New Sub-EO</strong> link to add a new employer organization (as demonstrated above starting on step 3). Employer organizations and "Sub-EO's" are both employer organizations in the system. The terminology of "Sub-EO" is only used to describe a hierarchical relationship of one or more employer organizations.

10. <em>Work Locations</em> can also be related to an employer organization. Oftentimes work locations are related to employer organizations for Health Surveillance and/or Incident and OSHA reporting. Click the <strong>Edit/Pencil Icon</strong> on the <em>Work Locations</em> section. Use the autocomplete to search for existing work locations. Or click the <strong>Add New Work Location</strong> link to add a new work location. Not all customers use or need work locations configured. Consult with a deployment or support team member to discuss work locations and location hierarchy.

11. The <em>Chart Types</em> section lists the chart types utilized by this employer organization. It is recommended that customers not change the Chart Types unless instructed by Deployment or Support Consultant. Users must have Manage Chart Types security to modify chart types.
12. Select the <strong>Submit</strong> button. The system creates and displays the employer organization.
