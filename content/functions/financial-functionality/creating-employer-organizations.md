An employer organization to be added as a sub-employer organization must already be in the system and an employer organization. If it is not, first create the employer organization that will be subordinate or [change an organization to an employer organization](changing-organizations-to-employer-organizations.md).

Before persons can be added as contacts of the employer organization, their information must be in the system in contact charts. See [Adding contacts to accounts](adding-contacts-to-employer-organizations.md).

1. [Find employer organizations](finding-employer-organizations.md) to ensure the employer organization to create is not already in the system. If it exists as an organization rather than an employer organization, stop here and see [Changing organizations to employer organizations](changing-organizations-to-employer-organizations.md).
2. Select <strong>Add New</strong>. The <em>Enter Information</em> page appears.
3. On <em>Enter Information</em> page, in <strong>Name</strong> field, type name of employer organization.
4. Select <strong>Add New</strong> button. The employer organization account page appears.
5. Select the <strong>Overview (EO)</strong> tab.
6. In the <em>Employer Organization</em> section, select <strong>Edit</strong>. Complete the <strong>Search Name</strong> and <strong>Acronym</strong> fields in the section.
7. In the <em>Partition</em> field, select <strong>Employer Organization (EO)</strong>.
8. Complete the remaining fields in the section.
9. Select the <strong>Next</strong> button.
10. To add contacts to the employer organization, see TBD Adding contacts to employer organizations.
11. To add accounts to the employer organization, see TBD Adding accounts to employer organizations.
12. To add a sub-employer organization to the employer organization, in the <em>Sub-Employer Organizations</em> section, select the <strong>Edit</strong> button. In the <em>Name</em> field, type the name of the employer organization to add as a sub-employer organization. The system displays matching employer organizations. Select the <strong>appropriate employer organization</strong>. Select the <strong>Add</strong> button. Select the <strong>Next</strong> button.
13. Do not change the <em>Chart Types</em> section.
14. Select the <strong>Submit</strong> button. The system creates and displays the employer organization.
