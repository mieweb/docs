If an organization exists in the system and is not an employer organization but needs to be, do the following to change it to an employer organization rather than creating one.
1. [Find employer organizations](gdoc:1Al_53cJIgXetnbNLD0FLUXjIy7Gul0aHAPQJGPHwNdg).
2. From the search results, select the name of the organization to change. The system displays information about the organization.
3. In the <em>Charts Types</em> section, select the <strong>edit</strong> button.

4. In the <em>Chart Type</em> column, locate <strong>Organization</strong>. In the <em>Options</em> column, select the remove button. The <em>Organization</em> chart title appears struck out in the <em>Chart Type</em>  
    column.<img src="../changing-organizations-to-employer-organizations.assets/100000000000011A000000B54FB7319F588B0B7B.png" />  

5. From the <em>Chart Type</em> field, choose <strong>Employer Organization</strong>. Select the <strong>Add</strong> button. The <em>Employer Organization</em> chart appears in the <em>Chart Type</em> column.
6. Select the <strong>Submit</strong> button. In the <em>Chart Types</em> column, Organization no longer appears and Employer Organization appears.
