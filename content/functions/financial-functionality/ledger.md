Use the financial ledger functionality to track and reconcile periodic revenue and transactions, like an accounting system. Each employer organization (EO) has a ledger to view open or historical activity. The financial ledger provides a bird's-eye view of the overall account balance and has a friendly view of all the transactions and includes a credit/debit column for itemized details.    
Before ledger and financial functionality can be used, give user security roles access to the ledger. See [Allowing user security roles to access ledger](gdoc:16mRc8J0pBrOwb2iPNF4WzPxSkPCkqj0XzH_iZORsJco). Also, for users to be able to work with fees in encounter visits, they need access to fees. See [Configuring access to encounter charges](gdoc:1ZOGOaZqB2_SoMwy14nI5Z4C2Ih3Fi1j0GG6A6KHL_vM).
