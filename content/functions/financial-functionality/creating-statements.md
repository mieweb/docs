    1. In the <em>Dates</em> area, in the left month, date, and year fields, type a month, date, and year or select <strong>Today</strong> to use today's month, date, and year or select <strong>Calendar</strong> to select a month, date, and year from a calendar.
    2. In the right month, date and year fields, type a month, date, and year or select <strong>Today</strong> to use today's month, date, and year or select <strong>Calendar</strong> to select a month, date, and year from a calendar.
