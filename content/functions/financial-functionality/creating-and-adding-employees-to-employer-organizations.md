Typically, employees are added to employer organizations automatically based on information from human resources systems. However, they can also be added manually.

1. [Find the employer organization](finding-employer-organizations.md) to which to add an employee.
2. Select the <strong>Admin (EO/PO)</strong> tab. A menu appears. From the menu, select <strong>Employees</strong>. The system displays a list of employees of the employer organization.
