Note that the system treats the dates specified in the *Begin Date* and *End Date* fields as inclusive of the effective periods of fee schedules.

For example, if there is a fee schedule effective from the first day of this month to the last day of this month and a date next month is entered in the *End Date* field, the system will not find this fee schedule because the date is outside of that fee schedule's effective period.

1. Select the side menu. The side menu appears.
2. Select <strong>Control Panel</strong>. The <em>Admin</em> tab opens.
3. From the <em>Module</em> list, select <strong>Fee Schedule</strong>. The <em>Fee Schedules</em> page appears.
