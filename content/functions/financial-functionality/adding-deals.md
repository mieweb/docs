## Deal Encounter

Complete each section of the Deal.

### Parties

The Employer Organization will default to the EO for which the deal is being created. Use the autocomplete to enter the Provider Organization (the EH Client), then proceed to the next section. Adding a PO is **REQUIRED**.

In the ‘Name' field, type the name of the contact for the employer or provider organization. The system shows matching contacts. Select the contact.

In the ‘Role' field, select ‘Signatory Contact'. Select the ‘Add' button. Repeat to add another contact, if appropriate. Then select ‘Next'.

### Details

Enter a Title, Start Date and End Date. These items are **REQUIRED**. Before the deal is considered active, the Deal must also indicate that the contract has been executed (Executed=Yes). In some client configuration scenarios, a deal may be created, but an official contract between the two has not yet been finalized. A Deal can be made and set to Executed=No, meaning this Deal has not been executed yet and not "live" in the system. Executed=Yes is **REQUIRED** before the deal is recognized in the system.

    * Note: If a client is authorized to use billing and loads them in their database, the billing will pull forward from the Orders-List Editor.
* A charge will not drop in an encounter without a code in the billing field. You do not need to use a billing code but a string of alpha/numeric characters needs to be listed here in order for the charge to drop on the encounter.

### Documents

The documents section is designed to show a list of any linked documents to this Deal. Clients may configure custom document types and scan/upload relevant linked documents to this deal. For example, a copy of the formal executed agreement could be scanned in and linked to this encounter. If this is done, a link to the document will display in this section. If there are no linked documents, this section will be blank/empty.

### Approval

Once all required information has been added in the Deal and the Deal executed flag is set to Yes, the Deal encounter must be closed to go into effect. Select the ‘Archive & Close' button to complete the Deal. If a Deal was created, but no longer needed or an official contract is never executed, ensure that the Executed field in the Details Section is set to No before clicking ‘Archive & Close'.
