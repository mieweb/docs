For each user security role or user account that needs access ledger functionality, change its security role or user account settings according to [Security Role Settings](../system-administration/security/security-role-settings.md). In the *Manage Ledger* field, choose the level of access:

* <strong>No</strong> (No visibility to the ledger and transactions.)
* <strong>View</strong> (View the ledger and transaction information only.)
* <strong>Add</strong> (View the ledger information and add transactions but cannot edit transactions.)
* <strong>Edit</strong> (View the ledger information and add and edit transactions.)
