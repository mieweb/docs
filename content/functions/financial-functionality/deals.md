Deals are based on contracts between an employer organization and a service provider to provide services. Use deals to:
* Override fee schedules (if they exist) and set charges for services.
* Communicate the services a provider is able to perform for employees of an employer organization involved in the deal.
A deal must identify the employer organization and provider organization involved. Each must already be set up in the system.
