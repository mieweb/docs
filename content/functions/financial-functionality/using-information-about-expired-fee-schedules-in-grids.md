Use the following information about expired fee schedules in a grid:
* Fee schedule name
* Begin date
* End Date
* Number of items in scheduleÂ 
1. [View expired fee schedules](viewing-expired-fee-schedules.md).
2. Above the <em>Fee Schedule Expired</em> section, select <strong>Show Grid</strong>. The information appears as a grid.
3. Work with the information as described in [Using DataVis Grids - Data Tools](../reports/using-datavis-grids-data-tools.md).
