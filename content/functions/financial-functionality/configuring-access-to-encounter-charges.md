For each user security role or user account that needs to view, add or edit charges in encounters, change its security role or user account settings according to [Security Role Settings](../system-administration/security/security-role-settings.md). In the *Manage Encounter Charges* field, choose the level of access:
* <strong>No</strong> (No access to charges in encounters.)
* <strong>View</strong> (View charges in encounters.)
* <strong>Add</strong> (View charges in encounters but cannot edit charges.)
* <strong>Edit</strong> (Edit charges in encounters and add and edit charges.)
