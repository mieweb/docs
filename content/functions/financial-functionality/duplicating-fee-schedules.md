Duplicate fee schedules to create a new fee schedule with the same fee schedule items and a different fee schedule name.

When duplicating a fee schedule, you can also set the prices of all items in the duplicate fee schedule to be a percentage of those in the original fee schedule. The costs of items in the duplicate fee schedule can also be set to a percentage of those in the original fee schedule. This is optional.

1. [Find the fee schedule](finding-fee-schedules.md) to which to duplicate or [view all fee schedules](viewing-all-fee-schedules.md).
2. In the <em>Fee Schedule</em> section, in the <em>OPTIONS</em> column of the fee schedule to duplicate, select <strong>duplicate</strong>. The <em>Add New Fee Schedule</em> window appears.
3. In the <em>Add New Fee Schedule</em> window, in the <em>Fee Schedule</em> Name field, enter a <strong>name for the new fee schedule</strong>.

5. In the <em>Cost Percentage</em> field, do one:
    1. To not change the costs of all items in the duplicate fee schedule, do not make an entry.
    2. To change the costs of all items in the duplicate fee schedule, enter a <strong>whole number or decimal number</strong> by which the costs of all items in the original fee schedule will be multiplied. For example, to double the costs of all items in the duplicate fee schedule, enter 2.

    1. To not change the prices of all items in the duplicate fee schedule, do not make an entry.
    2. To change the prices of all items in the duplicate fee schedule, enter a <strong>whole number or decimal number</strong> by which the prices of all items in the original fee schedule will be multiplied. For example, to halve the prices of all items in the duplicate fee schedule, enter .5.
7. Select <strong>Save</strong>. The system duplicates the fee schedule and sets costs and prices, if applicable. The fee schedule appears in the <em>Fee Schedule</em> section.
