A system setting controls the amount of time before a logged in user is determined as being idle and will automatically end their logged in session.

The system setting can be changed system wide to be a different value, but as a default, the Timeout is defaulted to 7200 seconds (which is 2 hours).

## Example of the timeout logout and log back in workflow

These screenshots will go through an example of how the timeout logout displays on your screen (once the system timeout threshold has been reached) and how to relog back into where you left off.

In this example, the Quick View sidemenu tab dashboard is where I'm working.  Then let's say I get a lengthy phone call and am idle here in the system.

After I am done with the phone call, I look back at my screen and I've been logged out.  The length of time that I can be idle in the system, before it will automatically log someone out, is the value of the system setting noted above (System / Login / Timeout).

In this example, I was idle in the system and hit the Timeout threshold, so the system logged me out while I was taking the phone call.  This is the screen I now see.

* There is a Warning pop-up that states I've been logged out and to click that OK button <strong>after</strong> I have logged back in
* There is a Login window pop-up at the top left where I can log back in first.

From the Login window pop-up at the top left, I need to log back into the system first.  Your system may have a different login screen look, this is simply an example.

1. Click that login screen pop-up window to <strong>maximize</strong> the window so you can see the whole screen login

2. Once the login screen is maximized, please log back in.  NOTE: Your system will have a different login screen look, this is simply an example.

3. Once logged back in, you will be shown the screen that has the warning pop-up about clicking OK after logging back in.  Since you are logged back in, please click that OK button on the pop-up window.

You will then be on the screen you idled out on (and where the system automatically logged you out after the timeout threshold was reached) and you can continue working in the system.
