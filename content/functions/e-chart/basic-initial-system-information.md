## Basic Initial System Information

We offer a Basic Navigation Overview LMS course in video format. Contact your Deployment Consultant if you would like access to that.  This guide will go over basic initial system information and navigation.  When logging into {{% system-name %}}, you will be set to land on a default page.  Likely, it will be the Quick View sidemenu tab.  However, users can change their default landing page upon login of the system by accessing My Settings in the **Control Panel** and changing the *Default Page* setting.

### Chart Simple Search Screen

Some users prefer to have their default landing page be the E-Chart sidemenu. The E-Chart side menu tab is the chart search screen. By default, users will be directed to the **Simple** search type, but a My Settings preference is available to change that default search type.

The Chart search screen is usually defaulted to search by **Name**.  When searching by name, users should enter the last name followed by a comma and then first letter or first name.  A wild card % search is available.  For instance, search by %erson if you wanted to find any charts who have *erson* within their last name.

Users can also search for charts by Medical Record Number, Social Security Number (entered with no dashes), Date of Birth, or by some phone number. Clicking the Phone number hyperlink allows users to toggle to search by alternate phone number, mobile phone number and work phone number as well.

![](../basic-initial-system-information.assets/3bc11841142b10626a60637a416fefb8.png)

If the search criteria entered finds an exact match for only one found chart, the user will automatically be taken into that chart.  Otherwise, a list of charts will be generated and the user can select any of the charts in the list of results, to access the chart.

{{% note %}}
Charts may be restricted to you.  You will find other help documentation guides around Locked or Restricted Charts.

If desired, the system can be configured to turn off the *Search by Social Security Number* option.  This will remove the SSN search ability from the Simple and Detailed chart search screens. It will also remove the Social Security column from the Recent Employees/Patients listing.   To turn off the social security search option in other modules or layouts, please contact MIE for assistance.

### Documents Chart Tab

Once accessing or working in a selected chart, {{% system-name %}} will include a **Documents** chart tab. By design, all documents stored in the chart will be mapped to this Documents catch-all chart tab unless otherwise changed by a system administrator.

![](../basic-initial-system-information.assets/0cbfc48bd93b553132951fc02b4f022e.png)

The number in parenthesis next to the title of a chart tab, in this case the Documents tab, indicates how many individual stored documents exist in that chart tab. If no number exists, no stored documents exist in that chart tab.

When searching for documents in the chart, users can either navigate to the specific individual chart tab a stored document may be mapped to or search in the Documents catch-all chart tab.  The Documents chart tab is intended to house this chart's stored documents, so that users have a central location for all that chart's documents, if necessary.

The Documents chart tab will list documents in chronological order, by default, with most recent dated stored documents being listed first.  The documents can also be sorted by using the Doc ID, Doc Type (lists documents in alpha order), subject columns, etc.  This is done by clicking on the underlined column headings such as Doc ID, Serv Date, Doc Type, Subject, etc.

{{% note %}}
If users click the Doc ID column heading, the list of documents will display in order of the unique assigned Document ID number, with the oldest Document (Doc) ID listed first.  Users can click the Doc ID heading a second time to reverse the order and display the most recent Doc ID first. This action of reversing the order can be done with any column heading.

{{% tip %}}
Users can hover their mouse over the Documents chart tab and it will display the name and date of the most current stored document in the chart.

To access a stored document to see its contents, the user can select any stored document to view it, from within the list view.

You can change your document view preference when in any chart tab.  This is done by using the dropdown located in the top-right corner of a chart tab.

### Other Chart Tabs Within a Chart

Users can click on any chart tab located at the top of the charts to view or enter information, depending on the information needing recorded and the functionality of the chart tab. Some chart tabs are made up of sub-tabs.  Clicking on the main parent tab will expand the listing of sub-tabs available to access from that chart.

![](../basic-initial-system-information.assets/190e8bfb82c054ebe78a571e5f655ba6.png)

Chart tabs that have stored documents mapped to them, will display a number in parentheses next to the chart tab name, indicating how many stored documents exist of that type, for that specific chart.  If no number exists, this indicates that no documents are stored in that particular chart tab or the chart tab functionality is not set up to store documents, but rather is setup to enter information such as medications/allergies, conditions, demographics, etc.

### Home Landing Page

Clicking the Home icon located towards the top-left corner of the screen will navigate you back to your default landing screen.  The default landing page is defined per user in the My Settings chart tab of the **Control Panel**. The *Default Page* preference selected setting drives this navigation.

### Changing My Settings Preferences Per User

Users who have security access to My Settings within the Control Panel sidemenu tab are able to set their own preference defaults, but some administrators may be able to change My Setting preferences for other users, individually or system-wide.

![](../basic-initial-system-information.assets/dda2ae4d2e42744aa0c87b5eb415f0ab.png)

The My Settings screen will default to the logged-in user's settings.  This can be changed by clicking the dropdown option in the upper-right corner of the screen if you have security permission.

{{% note %}}
You will find other help documentation guides around all the detailed My Settings preferences available.

Depending on your workflows and operating procedures, there may be some specific My Settings Preferences to set when an administrator is needing to set up a new user to their system.  Please work with your Deployment Consultant to identify those preferences that would be best to have set for the new user to have a successful initial experience.  Some of those may be for instance: Default Location, Time Zone, Starting Partition, Ordering Location, etc.

To save any changes to the My Settings screen,click on the **Submit Settings** button found at the top or the bottom of this screen.

![](../basic-initial-system-information.assets/0214791ff9ad0037c9c9024444dd2f76.png)

Once the changes have been saved, the user will receive a message to indicate that the setting updates were successful.

To log out of the system, click the Logout sidemenu option.

{{% note %}}
A system setting controls the amount of time before a logged in user is determined as being idle and will automatically end their logged in session.  The system setting for Timeout is defaulted to 7200 seconds (which is 2 hours).
