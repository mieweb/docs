![](../quick-view-schedule-portlet-and-my-schedule-portlet.assets/4875d3aeea4ae6fdbd080f9970078255.png)

Once the user has entered search criteria, the selection will remain sticky until changed.

Users can select a location(s), a resource(s), the schedule date and time of day they wish to view on the portlet to list existing scheduled appointments. The **Location** and **Resource** are autocomplete fields in which users may select one or multiple locations and resources. The **Resource field** is required when searching for scheduled appointments. The **Date** entered should be the date the user wishes to view the scheduled appointments for. Users may search for today or for dates in the past or future. The **Time** option dropdown allows the user to limit the search to display all appointments for the day, just the morning or just the afternoon for the given day. Once search criteria has been entered, click the **Search** button to display the schedule.

### Schedule Portlet Search Results/Listing

Once the Search button has been clicked, the schedule information will display beneath the search criteria.

Each appointment listed on the schedule shows details, allows interoperable functionality, and is color coded by the appointment type that your system is configured to display for easy visualization.

**Time**: Displays the time slot of the scheduled appointment. This is a hyperlink that can be used to advance to the Reschedule/Cancel appointment screen for this scheduled appointment.

**Chart**: Displays the name of the chart that is scheduled for the appointment. This is a hyperlink that can be used to advance to the chart's Summary dashboard and chart contents.

**Options Column**: There are some options available from the Schedule quick view portlet:

* <strong>Checkin</strong> hyperlink<strong>:</strong> Allows users to Check in using that hyperlink to one-click checkin for the scheduled appointment from this portlet.
* <strong>Checked Out</strong> hyperlink<strong>:</strong> Signifies the person has been checked out, but one can click this hyperlink to check them back in if needed from this portlet.
* <strong>Checkin Station Name</strong> hyperlink<strong>:</strong> Displays the various station names of where the person is at the moment at the clinic (and how long they've been in that station).  As patients move through their visit, stations may change and update here.  This is a quick visual to see ‘where' physically the patient is in your clinic.  The station is a hyperlink that can be clicked here to quickly <em>move</em> the patient to another station as needed, from this portlet.
* <strong> [+] icon</strong>: Allows users to only create/add the encounter (that is configured to that specific appointment type) and does <strong>not</strong> check the chart in for their scheduled appointment. This may be used when needing to prepare the encounter for the appointment, but not check the person in for their appointment yet. When the <strong>+</strong> icon is selected, the associated encounter, if configured, will automatically be created & will open and the user will be redirected to the opened encounter. The Encounter section will default the encounter to the date/time of the scheduled appointment (NOT the date/time the encounter was created/opened), as well as display the linked appointment type. If the patient is later checked in, and an encounter was previously created/opened using this [+] icon, a second encounter will not be created.  The user will be directed to the existing encounter. If an encounter was not previously opened at the time of check in, then the existing functionality has not changed. In this case, any associated encounter will automatically be opened for the user upon Checkin.

**Stage**: Displays the encounter stage of the appointment's linked encounter.  Not all encounters utilize stages, so it is common for this column to be empty.

**Status** padlock: The green open padlock icon indicates that the linked encounter (to this appointment) is still open (meaning, the encounter has not been closed & archived yet). One can actually quickly click on the green open lock icon to closed & archive the encounter from here.  The red closed padlock icon indicates that its linked encounter (to this appointment) has been closed & archived.  One cannot reopen the encounter from here though.

### My Schedule Portlet Search

When users view the My Schedule Portlet, the search information will be empty upon each time utilizing the portlet.

* Three differences from the other optional Schedules portlet:
1. My Schedule portlet will default to populate today's date in the search
2. Other search fields will not be remembered/do not stay sticky after performing a search (thus, refreshes to blank search/contents upon each time utilizing)
3. Does not offer the ability to create the encounter for the appointment without also checking them in for their appointment (thus, only offers checkin)

Users can select a location(s), a resource(s), the schedule date and time of day they wish to view on the portlet to list existing scheduled appointments.
