When in the {{% system-name %}} system, the E-Chart sidemenu tab displays recent charts you've accessed, along with the ability to search for charts by different methods.  E-Chart automatically defaults to search in **Simple** search, but there is a My Settings preference named *Search Method* that can be changed for your login experience.  See more information within the My Settings help guide.

To do a more detailed search, click the Detailed link from the list of Search Types.

The detailed search filter screen will open with various filter fields to help narrow down a search for a chart by more detail.

Within the Detailed search screen, there are many fields you can create a detailed search for and many criteria you can select from in each drop-down field. It is not necessary to select or set something in every field. You can search by any or as many fields as you wish in order to narrow down your results. The more fields filled out, the more detailed and narrower the search.

## Contains Search

The percent sign (%) is a hotkey to perform a CONTAINS search, followed by the letters you wish to search. In this example, we typed %art in the name field and clicked the **Search** button.  The system resulted matching charts with names of the letters ‘art' in them.

When done keying in any detailed search criteria fields, click the **Search** button to render the results or the **Clear All** button to start another search.

## SSN Search

By default, {{% system-name %}} system setting *Search for SSN* is disabled via a system setting.

{{% note %}}
Disabling the SSN search does not turn off the ability to search by SSN in other modules or layouts. Contact your MIE Implementer if you wish SSN search to be turned off in other modules/layouts of  {{% system-name %}}.
{{% /note %}}

If *Search for SSN* is enabled via a system setting, the SSN radio button will display in the search field criteria and the "SSN" column will display. That will allow for searching by SSN from simple and detailed searches, as well as the Document Queue search. If your practice wishes not to offer the search by SSN nor show the "SSN" column in the patient search screen, make sure the system setting is disabled.

## Preferred Name Search

Preferred Name fields are extra fields in demographics of a chart that can be used to key in a person's preferred name separate from their legal name. These can be manually entered or filled in by your HR interface. Data from these fields can be seen in several places throughout the product including Demographics Information, the chart header, the demographics portlet (Summary tab) and document list views. Users may also search for charts by Preferred Last Name and Preferred First Name.

![](../detailed-searching-in-e-chart.assets/424b538479e0354e6ae02111f5434ed7.png)

Two system settings are available to enable if with to allow chart searching to include preferred name.  Both system settings are disabled by default, but can be enabled at the practice's discretion.

When the *Show Preferred Name Column* in Recent Patients List View system setting is enabled, a new column called "PREFERRED" will display in the Recent Patient/Employee list. This displays any Preferred Name contents that a chart may have in it, while looking at your *Recent Charts* listing in E-Chart or in Quick View portlet.

When the system setting *Show Preferred Name on Results* in Patient Search is enabled, the Simple and Detail patient search will return results that BEGIN or contain (% wildcard search) with the name or the preferred name.

![](../detailed-searching-in-e-chart.assets/d65c10c13bc02c348838de6ce255651f.png)

Detailed search looks for preferred name contents in the *first name* separated field.

## Detailed Search DataVis Experiment

A new My Settings preference has been added (disabled by default) to enable a Detail Patient Search Datavis output.  This is a My Settings preference that only affects you, the logged in user.

![](../detailed-searching-in-e-chart.assets/46061004a1e9e0094664b94dbd00727e.png)

If enabled as your preference, when using **Detailed Search** within the Patient Search of E-Chart, the Search fields will display cosmetically different and your search output will be in a datavis format, where one can filter, sort, pivot, etc as needed.  Utilizing a datavis method for Detailed patient chart search will also allow columns to be added to the output as needed.
