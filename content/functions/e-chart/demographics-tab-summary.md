To navigate to the patient **Demographics** chart tab, search for the chart from the E-Chart sidemenu. Get into the chart, and click on the **Admin** chart tab. Demographics is available as a subtab of the Admin chart tab.

The Demographics chart tab displays a dark grey header that will contain the name, chart status, age, date of birth, sex, home phone number, next appointment information, along with the medical record number. Additionally, a counter for Tasks, Open Encounters, Due List, Order Requistions and eSigns relating to the patient.

The dark grey demographics header will display on all tabs when in the chart, not just the Demographics chart tab.

Allergies, current medications and current conditions can be displayed in the Demographics header. These are driven by My Settings preferences. Following the demographics header are any alerts entered into the chart, displayed in red.

Following the medical header, users can utilize the remaining quick links to see revisions to the chart demographics (**Patient Revisions**).

The demographics chart tab will also display the patient's photo if one exists.  This is to assist with patient identification. From here, users can click the **Add Photo** or **Retake Photo** icon.  When users click the Retake Photo link, the Add Document screen will open/display, allowing users to upload a new photo using the picture-add method.

Once the new photo is uploaded, it will replace the existing/previous photo. The existing/previous photo will be stored as a document in the patient chart. Users can scan drivers' licenses to use as patient photos, if desired.  Users will need to access the Add Document screen and select **E-Chart Scan** for the picture-add method, instead.

The Employment Information section is also part of the demographics summary tab. The Employer Name, Address, Hire Date, Termination Date, Employee Class and Status, Work Location and Cost Center are just some of the fields that are available out of the box in this section. Many of these fields can be part of an HR integration.

The Marital / Contact Information section is part of the demographic summary tab. This section is used primarily for Emergency Contact information. The section also includes Marital Status, Spouse's Name and Birth Date.

The Contact / Relationship section of the Demographics tab contains Employer Organization and Supervisor information. There are also fields for User Relationships, Chart Relationships and Pharmacy information.

The Other Data section allows additional observations to be captured that would otherwise require an update to the standard demographics layouts. The standard Other Data section includes fields for Birth Sex, Gender Identity, Sexual Orientation, Personal Pronouns, and Previous Names. The implementation or App support team at MIE can update this section for the best use case for the client.

The Employee Numbers section allows for adding and updating the patient partition. When a new partition is selected with the checkbox, the patient will have an additional MRN created.

The Chart Type section allows for the needed chart types to be set from the Demographics tab. By default, when creating the Chart, the Patient chart type is selected. If a new or different chart type needs to be set, this is where it can be completed.

The ability to add insurance, show or hide inactive insurance information is also provided in the demographics summary tab.  Please refer to [Insurance Summary-Demographics Tab](insurance-summary-in-demographics-tab.md) help documentation for more details.

Users also have the ability to merge duplicate charts from the demographics chart tab. If the system finds a possible duplicate chart based on matching demographics, the possible duplicate chart(s) will display information such as  chart name, date of birth, and match rating. Users should open/display the chart that they wish to keep. Then, either checkmark the **Select** box for the appropriate chart *that should be merged* or click the **Manual Search** link to manually search for the chart that should be merged with the current one.
