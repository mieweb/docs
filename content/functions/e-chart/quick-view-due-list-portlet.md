The **Due List portlet** found on the [Quick View](https://system/) page is a grid-like report of any chart with at least one pending due list item. By default, the portlet lists any and all charts and MRNs that have something in a **Pending** status on their **Due List**. There are other columns of information, as well as function buttons at the bottom of the report, to work pending due list items en masse for the system. This grid can be sorted, filtered, and arranged as you prefer, without affecting other users.

A **Due List** is a list of pending tests/procedures (order items) with due dates. These can be managed in dynamic encounters, as well as from the individual chart Due List chart tab, or from this portlet. The list serves as a reminder for what is due or what is coming due or what is past due during an office visit for all charts in the system.  The Due List portlet appears as a list in grid format, able to be sorted as needed.  
Each column on the Due List can be used to sort or filter items in the table.

Find the question mark (?) icon on each column to sort and/or filter by specific criteria shown in the pop-up screen. When users set the sort and/or filters, the system will remember the user's preference.  Therefore, the next time a user comes to this portlet to view or manage order items, the due list will be shown the same way (along with filters).  
{{% note %}}

If you filter out rows, those will be filtered out on future sessions/charts you work in.

{{% /note %}}

Drag and drop a column name to change the order of columns.

You can also drag and drop a column name and place it into the table header to group items in the table by that column. In this example, the Order Name and Type columns were dragged up into the table header, and now the list sorts and arranges by those.

When you drag & drop to arrange, the system will remember this.  Therefore, next time you come to view this Due List portlet, the due list will be displayed in that arrangement.  
  
## **Refresh**  

The **Due List portlet** can be refreshed at any time, to provide the most up-to-date information. This may be needed because other staff work the due list and update orders throughout the day. Click the gear icon in the right corner of the portlet. The refresh button will appear at the left of the portlet.  The user can click the refresh button instead of having to get out of the portlet and back in to refresh its contents.

## **Collapse**  

The carrot icons on the right corners of the Due List portlet act as a show/hide (expand/collapse) of the section.

## **Details**  

From any due list item listed, there is a **Details** hyperlink column.  

  
![](../quick-view-due-list-portlet.assets/10000201000004A100000199B550B2563F06707F.png)  


Clicking on Details for a specific due list item will show information about the specific due list order item (from the [order item list editor](https://system/?f=orders&s=list_editor&t=List+Editor&tabmodule=admin&tabselect=Orders-List+Editor)) along with revision history.

## **Next Appt**  

The Due List grid will display the chart's next scheduled appointment date if there is one already scheduled in the future. This is the date/time of the next upcoming scheduled appointment, regardless of appointment type. The system will also display the words **On Waitlist** in that column if the chart has any pending waitlist appointments needing to be scheduled (though not necessarily for those due list items).

## **Go to the Waitlist**  

The Due List grid will display a hyperlink to access the waitlist module.  Click Go To The Waitlist to quickly access the [WaitList](https://system/?func=scheduler&s=wait_list).

  
![](../quick-view-due-list-portlet.assets/100002010000049C000001A27A7F210DD0FEB269.png)  


Upon clicking [Go To The Waitlist](https://system/?func=scheduler&s=wait_list), you will be taken to the Waitlist module within the **Scheduler**. This is a list of all waitlist appointments in the system. There are filter criteria at the top, to limit search results, if needed. A waitlist appointment can be scheduled with a specific resource, date, time, location, etc. by clicking **Edit** next to the specific waitlist appointment line item.  Please refer to other help documentation named [Waiting List Tab](../scheduling/waiting-list-tab.md) for more information.
