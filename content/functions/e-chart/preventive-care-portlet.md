You can select the *Preventive Care* portlet for your view on the Patient Summary chart tab view.

![](../preventive-care-portlet.assets/ea212d5ed2da00c69fb988a796edd8b1.png)

This shows procedures and can be customized to show screenings/procedures you manage and also specific screenings only show here based on possible age and gender criteria (ex: male patients you wouldn't see Pap Smear or Mammogram Screening procedures to manage).

Clicking on the *manage info* icon will take you to the chart tab where the Preventive Care editor is housed in your system.

The patient could have an office visit and you ask when their last mammogram was and they say 1989, so you enter that. Then you order a mammogram and the mammogram report comes into your system thru some method and is stored as doc.type MAMMO so, the *last documented in patient record* of an actual mammogram report document you have is shown with the date of service of the document. Then when the patient comes back in, you can update the â€˜completed date'.

This Preventive Care portlet can also be added as a section in your encounters for documenting there also and help with meaningful use measures.
