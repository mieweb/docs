Reporting is an important aspect of any business. That's why {{% system-name %}} provides a wealth of resources to cover almost any reporting needs.

Beginning in RC202509, reports will display with a **Star** icon to the left of each report name. When the star has been selected, the report will display in the reports **Favorites** tab, which has also been added in this release. Unselecting the Star icon will remove the report from the Favorites tab.
