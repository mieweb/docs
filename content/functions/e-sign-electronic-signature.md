{{% system-name %}} offers the ability for electronic signature, or an e-sign option, designed to improve workflow efficiency. E-signatures can be requested manually, with notes and comments, or automatically, using e-sign routing rules. The built-in alerts and notifications allow users to review e-sign requests and queues, completed correspondences, transcription reports, lab and test results, and hospital documents. The E-Sign module also allows for adding documents, tasks, and dictations, as well as requesting co-signers, or multiple signatures, as needed.
