## Clinical Instructions  

  
### New UI Visit Encounter (valid RC202109+)  


  
### Original Visit Encounter  
  
Using the Social History section of the encounter, ensure smoking status is documented and additional details are noted with the respective status (i.e., current smoker, former smoker, etc.). Cessation counseling or medications should be noted, when applicable, in order to populate the numerator appropriately.
1. While documenting the Visit Encounter, open the Social History section.
2. Assess Smoking Status: (select one)
   1. Current every day smoker
   2. Current some day smoker
   3. Former smoker
   4. Never smoker
   5. Heavy tobacco smoker
   6. Light tobacco smoker
   7. Smoker, current status unknown
   8. Unknown if ever smoked
1. Based on the selected smoking status, additional fields/choices may need addressed (e.g., Age Started, Age Quit, Cessation Counseling, etc.). Answer accordingly.
{{% note %}}
   When marking the radio button for Cessation Counseling, the date MUST be entered as well. Selecting only the radio button or providing only a date of counseling will not satisfy the measure.
{{% /note %}}
     
2. Continue documenting the encounter as appropriate
3. When complete, Close and Archive the encounter
