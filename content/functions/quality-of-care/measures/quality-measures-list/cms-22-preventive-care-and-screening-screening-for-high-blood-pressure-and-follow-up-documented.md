## Clinical Instructions  
  
Track all 18+ year-old patients screened for high blood pressure, and ensure those with a pre-hypertensive or hypertensive blood pressure reading have a follow-up plan recommended and documented. Pre-hypertension is defined by blood pressure readings with a systolic pressure from 120 to 139 mm/Hg or a diastolic pressure from 80 to 89 mm/Hg. Hypertension is defined by readings greater than or equal to 140/90 mm/Hg.
  
### Preferred Workflow  

1. While documenting the Visit encounter, record the blood pressure, as appropriate
2. Open the Vitals section and enter the systolic and diastolic pressures
3. If the blood pressure is high and the patient is assessed prehypertensive or hypertensive, recommend a follow-up plan and document, accordingly
   1. Open the Preventive Care section
   2. Open the Hypertension Interventions picklist
   3. Order the appropriate follow-up items(s) for the patient
   OR
   4. E-prescribe an appropriate hypertension medication
5. Continue documenting the encounter, as needed
6. When completed, Close and Archive the encounter
  
### Alternate Workflow  

1. While documenting the Visit encounter, record the blood pressure, as appropriate
2. Open the Vitals section and enter the systolic and diastolic pressures
3. If the blood pressure is high and the patient is assessed prehypertensive or hypertensive, recommend a follow-up plan and document, accordingly
4. Complete and provide the follow-up plan, as appropriate
5. Continue documenting the encounter, as needed
6. When completed, Close and Archive the encounter
