## Clinical Instructions  
  
Ensure the system is configured to order, track, and archive referrals appropriately creating documents with allowable SNOMED Concept IDs. This includes configuration for scanning and indexing functionality, so that reports, consultations, referral letters, or the like can be scanned into and indexed within the system and be tracked appropriately. With configurations in place, use the encounter visit orders to refer a patient out, and when the receipt of the appropriate report/consultation is received, link to the referral order and complete.
  
### Workflow  
  
In an encounter  
Open Visit orders section  
Make referral order  
Refer to outside provider


1. While documenting the Visit Encounter, use the Visit Orders to create a Referral.
{{% note %}}
   * The out-of-the-box referral order document type (ORDREF) needs to be saved with LOINC 47045-0.
   * The Ordering Provider field must be the performing provider (i.e., not the nurse, MA, or staff) in order for the performing provider to satisfy the measure.  
   * All referral orders created for a patient during the reporting period must be Completed in order for the patient to count in the numerator.
{{% /note %}}
1. When entering the fields of the referral order, ensure the Refer To field is specified.

{{% note %}}
