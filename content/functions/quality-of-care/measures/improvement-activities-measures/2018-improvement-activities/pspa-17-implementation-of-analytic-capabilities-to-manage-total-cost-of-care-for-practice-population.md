**Activity Weighting**: Medium

**Subcategory Name**: Patient Safety and Practice Assessment

**Description**: Build the analytic capability required to manage total cost of care for the practice population that could include one or more of the following:

* Train appropriate staff on interpretation of cost and utilization information; and/or
* Use available data regularly to analyze opportunities to reduce cost through improved care.

Supporting Documentation

1. Staff Training - Documentation of staff training on interpretation of cost and utilization information (e.g. training certificate); or
2. Cost/Resource Use Data - Availability of cost/resource use data for the practice population that is used regularly to analyze opportunities to reduce cost.
