**Activity Weighting**: Medium  
**Subcategory Name**: Patient Safety and Practice Assessment  
**Description**: Build the analytic capability required to manage total cost of care for the practice population that could include one or more of the following:
* Train appropriate staff on interpretation of cost and utilization information; and/or
* Use available data regularly to analyze opportunities to reduce cost through improved care.




Supporting Documentation
1. Staff Training - Documentation of staff training on interpretation of cost and utilization information (e.g. training certificate); or 
2. Cost/Resource Use Data - Availability of cost/resource use data for the practice population that is used regularly to analyze opportunities to reduce cost.
