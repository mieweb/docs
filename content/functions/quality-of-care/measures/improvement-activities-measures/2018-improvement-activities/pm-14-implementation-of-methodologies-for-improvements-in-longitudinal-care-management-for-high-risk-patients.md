**Subcategory Name**: Population Management  
**Description**: Provide longitudinal care management to patients at high risk for adverse health outcome or harm that could include one or more of the following:
* Use a consistent method to assign and adjust global risk status for all empaneled patients to allow risk stratification into actionable risk cohorts. 
* Monitor the risk-stratification method and refine as necessary to improve accuracy of risk status identification;
* Use a personalized plan of care for patients at high risk for adverse health outcome or harm, integrating patient goals, values and priorities; and/or
* Use on-site practice-based or shared care managers to proactively monitor and coordinate care for the highest risk cohort of patients.




Supporting Documentation
1. High Risk Patients - Identification of patients at high risk for adverse health outcome or harm; and 
2. Use of Longitudinal Care Management - Documented use of longitudinal care management methods including at least one of the following: 
   1. empaneled patient risk assignment and risk stratification into actionable risk cohorts; or 
   2. personalized care plans for patients at high risk for adverse health outcome or harm; or 
   3. evidence of use of on-site practice based or shared care managers to monitor and coordinate care for highest risk cohort.
