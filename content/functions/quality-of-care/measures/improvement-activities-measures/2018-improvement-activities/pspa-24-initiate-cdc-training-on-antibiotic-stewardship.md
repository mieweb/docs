**Activity Weighting**: Medium

**Subcategory Name**: Patient Safety and Practice Assessment

**Description**: Completion of greater than 50 percent of the modules of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention antibiotic stewardship course. Note: This activity may be selected once every 4 years, to avoid duplicative information given that some of the modules may change on a year by year basis, but over 4 years there would be a reasonable expectation for the set of modules to have undergone substantive change, for the improvement activities performance category score.

Supporting Documentation
