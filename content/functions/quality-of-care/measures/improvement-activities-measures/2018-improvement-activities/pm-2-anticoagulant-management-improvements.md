**Activity Weighting**: High

**Subcategory Name**: Population Management

**Description**: Individual MIPS eligible clinicians and groups who prescribe oral Vitamin K antagonist therapy (warfarin) must attest that, for 60 percent of practice patients in the transition year and 75 percent of practice patients in Quality Payment Program Year 2 and future years, their ambulatory care patients receiving warfarin are being managed by one or more of the following improvement activities:

* Patients are being managed by an anticoagulant management service, that involves systematic and coordinated care, incorporating comprehensive patient education, systematic prothrombin time (PT-INR) testing, tracking, follow-up, and patient communication of results and dosing decisions;
* Patients are being managed according to validated electronic decision support and clinical management tools that involve systematic and coordinated care, incorporating comprehensive patient education, systematic PT-INR testing, tracking, follow-up, and patient communication of results and dosing decisions;
* For rural or remote patients, patients are managed using remote monitoring or telehealth options that involve systematic and coordinated care, incorporating comprehensive patient education, systematic PT-INR testing, tracking, follow-up, and patient communication of results and dosing decisions; and/or
* For patients who demonstrate motivation, competency, and adherence, patients are managed using either a patient self-testing (PST) or patient-self-management (PSM) program.
