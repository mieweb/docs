**Activity Weighting**: Medium  
**Subcategory Name**: Patient Safety and Practice Assessment  
**Description**:Â Administration of the AHRQ Survey of Patient Safety Culture and submission of data to the comparative database (refer to AHRQ Survey of Patient Safety Culture website [http://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/quality-patient-safety/patientsafetyculture/index.html](http://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/quality-patient-safety/patientsafetyculture/index.html)).  
{{% note %}}

This activity may be selected once every 4 years, to avoid duplicative information given that some of the modules may change on a year by year basis but over 4 years there would be a reasonable expectation for the set of modules to have undergone substantive change, for the improvement activities performance category score.
