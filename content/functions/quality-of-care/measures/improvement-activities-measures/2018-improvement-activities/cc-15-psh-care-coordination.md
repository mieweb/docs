**Activity Weighting**: Medium  
**Subcategory Name**: Care Coordination  
**Description**: Participation in a Perioperative Surgical Home (PSH) that provides a patient-centered, physician-led, interdisciplinary, and team-based system of coordinated patient care, which coordinates care from pre-procedure assessment through the acute care episode, recovery, and post-acute care. This activity allows for reporting of strategies and processes related to care coordination of patients receiving surgical or procedural care within a PSH. The clinician must perform one or more of the following care coordination activities:
* Coordinate with care managers/navigators in preoperative clinic to plan and implementation comprehensive post discharge plan of care;
* Deploy perioperative clinic and care processes to reduce post-operative visits to emergency rooms;
* Implement evidence-informed practices and standardize care across the entire spectrum of surgical patients; or
* Implement processes to ensure effective communications and education of patients' post-discharge instructions.
