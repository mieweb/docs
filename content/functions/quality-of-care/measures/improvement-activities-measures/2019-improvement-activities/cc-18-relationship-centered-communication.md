**Activity Weighting**: Medium

**Subcategory Name**: Care Coordination

**Description**: In order to receive credit for this activity, MIPS eligible clinicians must participate in a minimum of eight hours of training on relationship-centered care tenets such as making effective open-ended inquiries; eliciting patient stories and perspectives; listening and responding with empathy; using the ART (ask, respond, tell) communication technique to engage patients, and developing a shared care plan. The training may be conducted in formats such as, but not limited to: interactive simulations practicing the skills above, or didactic instructions on how to implement improvement action plans, monitor progress, and promote stability around improved clinician communication.
