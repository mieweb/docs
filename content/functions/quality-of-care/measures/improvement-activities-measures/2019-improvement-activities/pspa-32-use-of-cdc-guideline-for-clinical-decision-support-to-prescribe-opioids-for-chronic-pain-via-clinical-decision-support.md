**Activity Weighting**: High

**Subcategory Name**: Patient Safety and Practice Assessment

**Description**: In order to receive credit for this activity, MIPS eligible clinicians must utilize the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain[1] via clinical decision support (CDS). For CDS to be most effective, it needs to be built directly into the clinician workflow and support decision making on a specific patient at the point of care.

Supporting Documentation

Specific examples of how the guideline could be incorporated into a CDS workflow include, but are not limited to:

* electronic health record (EHR)-based prescribing prompts,
* order sets that require review of guidelines before prescriptions can be entered, and
* prompts requiring review of guidelines before a subsequent action can be taken in the record.
