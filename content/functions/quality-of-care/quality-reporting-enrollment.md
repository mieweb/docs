In order to better serve client needs, {{% system-name %}} has streamlined the concepts and efforts of quality reporting participation, in order to serve all interested entities. If, as a standard, a business would like to track ongoing quality of care initiatives, or even participate in sponsored quality programs, {{% system-name %}} systems now offer a plethora of quantifiable and reportable measures, designed to track and improve overall care delivery.

The following information is intended to walk users through the basic enrollment process, which will in turn allow for ongoing tracking of relevant care-specific data, processes, and outcomes. For detailed specifications regarding the available measures, please feel free to navigate to our [Measures Specifications](measures.md) documentation.

## Enroll via Quality Reporting Portlet

Ensure all participating provider profiles are edited with the correct National Provider Identifier (NPI) and Tax Identification Number (TIN), so that the JSON file to be submitted successfully uploads to the reporting website.

3. After the page loads, use the <em>Opt In</em> section to begin enrolling users, accordingly. Begin typing into the <strong>User</strong> autocomplete each name of the user(s)/provider(s) being enrolled. Multiple users/providers may be enrolled at one time.

4. If enrolling in a specific program, or one of the sponsored incentive programs, specify the <strong>Start/End Dates</strong> of the intended performance period. Otherwise, leave blank.

It is very important to select the correct measure associated with your Performance Period (i.e., 2018 measures for any performance period between 1-1-2018 to 12-31-2018, 2019 measures for any performance period between 1-1-2019 to 12-31-2019, etc.). Be sure to enroll in ONLY the measures for which supporting documentation can be provided, as outlined by the measure specification. DO NOT enroll in any measures for which supporting documentation cannot be provided in the event of an audit.

6. Once all necessary measures have been selected, click the <strong>Submit</strong> button.

## Guided Enrollment

As a means to assist with determining the necessary number of measures associated with a given program, or to simply guide the process of enrollment, {{% system-name %}} offers links to help drive the overall process.

To begin, perform the following:

1. Navigate to the  {{% syslink "Quick View" "func=omniscope" %}}  from the sidemenu, and locate the <strong>Quality Reporting</strong> portlet.
2. Click the  {{% syslink "Enroll" "f=layout&module=MIPS&name=Advanced+Measure+Enrollment&user_id=50&redirect=f%3Domniscope&tabmodule=+" %}}  hyperlink to begin the enrollment process.  
    ![](../quality-reporting-enrollment.assets/0ddad2de40fa9ca8eb61cd9b194aa669.png)
3. After the page loads, click the <strong>Guided Enrollment</strong> link that corresponds with the preferred program or type of tracking being performed. In this example, the guided process will walk through the steps and necessities associated with the MIPS program, offered through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).

    ![](../quality-reporting-enrollment.assets/fb08bcfe36611564270e92d7aa04d1cc.png)
4. When the page loads, <strong>Instructions</strong> will display at the top of the page. Review these instructions and continue through each section of the program, as appropriate.

    ![](../quality-reporting-enrollment.assets/776d4cdadf62a295404af74447db9fce.png)
5. Use the <em>Opt In</em> section to begin enrolling users, accordingly. Begin typing into the <strong>User</strong> autocomplete each name of the user(s)/provider(s) being enrolled. Multiple users/providers may be enrolled at one time.
6. Because MIPS requires particular reporting periods for its measure categories, be sure to specify the <strong>Period</strong> for each performance category. Understand that all users/providers specified will be enrolled for the same period and measures selected. If different measures and periods are required for different users/providers, perform this step with each user/provider, individually. In this example, two providers will be enrolled for the minimum requirements and same performance period of the MIPS program.

7. When all of the measures have been selected for the performance category, click the <strong>Submit</strong> button.

{{% /warning %}}

8. If there are any additional performance categories, the page will refresh and load the instructions and Opt-In block, again, as well as any measures offered under that category. Follow the provided instructions and select any and all appropriate measures. Click the <strong>Submit</strong> button when ready to continue.
9. Continue until all categories of the program have been updated.
10. Once all categories are addressed and measures are successfully selected and submitted, Status for All Providers (enrolled) will display in grid form.

## Quality of Care Reports

The available quality reports can be found under the Quality of Care tab of the Reports module. Depending on what information is needed, select from the **Provider Quality of Care Status**, the **Patient Quality of Care Status** report, or the **Quality Benchmark Report**, among others.

![](../quality-reporting-enrollment.assets/1c83bdb8ee3b2a35c9526ac29c0dae9b.png)
After selecting the appropriate report, all relevant statuses for either patient encounters or providers will display. These reports provide an overall view of the collected data, as it relates to the available measures.
