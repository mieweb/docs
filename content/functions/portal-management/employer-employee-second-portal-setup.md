Setting up a portal for your employees to access is available in {{% system-name %}} . Your MIE Implementer will help with initial setup and configuration, but this help guide also helps for any edits or changes that may need done later down the road. Initial portal setup is in help guide named [Patient Portal First-Time Set-Up & Configuration](https://docs.enterprisehealth.com/functions/portal-management/patient-portal-first-time-setup-and-configuration/)_._

There may be a need for a second portal of a different url and different users related to different provider organizations, etc accessing that specific portal than accessing the initial Generic Portal that comes by default. To set up an additional portal:

From the sidemenu tab _Provider Management_, then click Add New Provider Organization to set up and name a second portal.

Enter in a name for this provider organization if one doesn't already exist. For this help guide, we will be using the name _Top Level_ as an example of a second portal.

The screen will refresh to the _Overview_ page of the newly created provider organization.

In this _Overview_ tab, scroll down to the bottom section named **Chart Types** and click to expand that section. Add an additional chart type of **Portal** to this chart. Then click the NEXT button to save the work.

After you click NEXT, click the _Overview_ chart tab again to refresh the entire page. You will then see all the portal setup tabs at the top being applied since you set this provider organization chart to be an additional chart type of "portal".

Click the _Portal Setup_ tab and begin configuration. See other help guide titled [Patient Portal First-Time Set-Up & Configuration](https://docs.enterprisehealth.com/functions/portal-management/patient-portal-first-time-setup-and-configuration/).

At any time, you can see what your real second portal will look like. First make sure you have a "supervisor" relationship on your username to another test user. Also make sure you are linked to your own chart as NoMoreClipboard User role (MIE Implementers can link to a test patient).

Simply go to the sidemenu tab _Quick View_, then have the portlet named _Employee Portal_ displayed on your screen. Within the _Employee Portals_ section you will see a button for the second portal you created. Click on that.

You will access the second portal and see the configuration you set up for it.
