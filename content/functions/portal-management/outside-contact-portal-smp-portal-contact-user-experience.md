## Contact Portal Activation Code Instructions

If a document has been sent to the ‘Outside Contact Portal', the recipient will receive an email with instructions on how to create an account (new users) or how to link the activation code to an existing portal account.

The Contact will click on the ‘portal' link in the email. The Activation code will automatically fill in for most browsers and proceed the user to the next screen. If this doesn't occur the code can be copied and pasted into the ‘Activation code' field, then click the ‘NEXT' button.

The ‘myself' radio button should default for the Contact user. The Contact will then need to verify their Email, create their own username and password. **_It is recommended that users use their email address as their username_**.

**NOTE:**** databases on 202403 and newer will require email to be used as the user name.**

Upon logging in, the outside contact lands on the Secure Message Portal main menu screen. The ‘Outside Contact Portal' (sometimes called "Secure Message Portal") displays the following information:

**MESSAGE**: Click on the ‘paper' icon for each line item to view the document.

**SERV DATE**: This is the service date of the document being shared.

**REGARDING**: This is the employee/individual for which the shared document is in regard to.

**BY**: This is the individual who created the document in the employee's chart.

**TYPE**: This is a document type description of the document being shared.

**DOCUMENTATION**: If the Outside portal is configured to accept replies from the outside contact, a "Reply To" (black reply arrow) icon will display. If the portal is not configured to accept replies, then this column will be blank.

To log out, click the **LOGOUT** button at the bottom of the shared documents list.

Emails containing portal activation codes and confirmation of portal accounts that are sent to the Contact will also display in the Contact chart, however, since they are emailed to the Contact directly, they are not shared as viewable documents on the portal.

After creating the ‘Outside Contact Portal' account, the Contact user will receive a confirmation email that they successfully created their account.

## Ongoing Received Document Notifications

Any time a new document is shared with an existing document, the contact will receive the OOTB ‘Reminder to Review Notification'.  The email may also require some modifications to suit many audiences it may be used for.

## Secure Messaging Portal Replies

Additional configuration is needed for clients that wish to have bidirectional Secure Messaging Portal. The Reply To feature is NOT configured OOTB and is billable to customers as T&M.

## Reply to a message

Once the SMP Portal Reply Configuration has been completed, users will see a "Reply To" arrow in the "DOCUMENTATION" column. Click on the Reply To icon to view and reply to the document.

![](../outside-contact-portal-smp-portal-contact-user-experience.assets/1566b25d4ffa37ab38a29b73af1b041a.png)

At the top of each document, the user will see the "Home" Icon. Clicking the "Home" icon will return the user back to the Secure Message Portal document list.

![](../outside-contact-portal-smp-portal-contact-user-experience.assets/6dbef0c82d95595f5d2bfb70f8892f84.png)

The user is immediately returned to the Outside Clinical Portal/Secure Message Portal document list. Once a reply has been created a new list called "Replies" will display on the bottom half of the screen. The top list displays new/unread messages. The bottom list displays replies to messages.

![](../outside-contact-portal-smp-portal-contact-user-experience.assets/731406c3b3c4c843fb27e6a74986cd1f.png)

Click the "Home" icon at the top of the page to return to the list. Click the Reply to icon to add more information, or click the "LOGOUT" button to exit the application.

# SMP Portal New Registration

If required, optional configuration allows the Outside Portal Contacts to send information on "new" patients that may not already be registered in the system.

Once the SMP new registration configuration is complete, a "NEW REGISTRATION" button will display in the lower left corner of the Outside Contact Portal/Secure Message Portal.

![](../outside-contact-portal-smp-portal-contact-user-experience.assets/8dcd07b545bb602eb691123f1fcf0bfe.png)

The Outside Contact may click on the "NEW REGISTRATION" button to create the chart and complete the SMP Questionnaire. The user is logged out of the Outside Contact Portal/Secure Message Portal to register the new chart.

## Co-branding Support

The "Outside Contact Portal", sometimes referred to as the "Secure Message Portal" will support standard portal headers and footers beginning in the 202409 release. The standard portal header will now display on this portal, including the co-brand logo and traditional portal signout method. The footer can be configured separately if desired.
