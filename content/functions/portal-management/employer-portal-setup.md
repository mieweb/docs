{{% system-name %}} offers various portal options, depending on the needs of the client. The **Employer Portal**, often referred to as the **Supervisor Portal**, **Agency Portal**, or **Leadership Portal**, streamlines employee engagement and tracking, offering easy access to due lists, employee work statuses, as well as health surveillance. Supervisors can not only view their personal information, but they can also view their employees' restrictions, lost time, work status, or any additional information custom to the business needs. To more fully address preferred configurations and review available options and features, utilize the {{% syslink "Provider Management" "f=layout&module=MASTER&name=EPM_Maintenance&tabmodule=+" %}} side menu to access and edit the {{% syslink "Employer Portal" "f=chart&s=pat&t=Employer+Portal&v=dashboard&pat_id=43" %}} , as needed.
  
## Employer Portal  
  
To begin configuring the Employer Portal, it first needs to be enabled from the **General Configuration** section of the {{% syslink "Portal Setup" "f=chart&s=pat&t=Portal+Setup&v=dashboard&pat_id=43" %}} tab. Utilize the Provider Management search to locate the Provider Organization (PO) *chart* that will house the portal configurations. 
  
### Initial Setup  
  
Again, before configuring the Employer Portal, it must be enabled within the system. To do this, perform the following: 
1. Navigate to the {{% syslink "Provider Management" "f=layout&module=MASTER&name=EPM_Maintenance&tabmodule=+" %}} side menu.
2. Type the name of the PO, and click the <strong>Search</strong> button.
3. Locate the PO Name, and click the hyperlink. In this example, we will be using {{% syslink "Better Corp" "f=chart&s=pat&pat_id=43" %}} .
