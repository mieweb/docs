A case is a full report of a workplace injury or an incident involving an employee (patient). The case is usually created in an initial visit (encounter) with the patient, and is then linked to subsequent visits. A case links all follow-up visits (encounters), restrictions, accommodations, conditions, and nature of injury information.  All of the documents pertaining to the case are grouped together within the chart for reporting purposes.

The terms *case* and *incident* may be used interchangeably throughout the system.

  
## Add New Absence Management Encounter  
  
From the Quick Links Portlet, click the Add Absence Management Encounter. The Absence Management Encounter will be opened and stay open until the patient returns to work or terminates, at which time the encounter **and** the case can be closed.

## Set Protocol  
  
  
Open the Chief complaint section of the encounter and use the autocomplete to select the Absence Management protocol.

## **Add New Absence Management Case**  
  
Some workflows use various documents or various encounters and may need to be linked to an Absence Management Case for tracking. To do this, a case type must first be created.  
By default, the Case section of encounters will display the following case types:
* Injury (OSHA Standard) 
* Injury (Non-OSHA Standard) 
* Hospital, Absence Management 
* Medical Suitability for Expatriate Assignment (MSEA)
* Medical Surveillance

If you wish to document a new case, click the header or **Edit** (Pencil) icon of the **Case** section in the dynamic encounter.

Once the **Case** section is expanded, indicate which type of case to create on the chart by selecting the appropriate radio button. The type of case selected will determine other fields or radio button data to complete. Once you open/create a case, any documentation, encounter visit documentations, or the like can be linked to a specific case/incident the chart has had previously documented.
  
## **Absence Management Case Details**  
  
After selecting to create an Absence Management case type, subsequent data fields branch open for documenting.  There are 2 required fields to capture before the system will save an Absence Management case to the chart. These are indicated by red asterisks. The other fields are optional and will most likely be keyed in at a later time, when managing the case throughout its life cycle.

The application will auto calculate the *Number of calendar days absent* if the *First day off* and **either** the *Actual RTW date* or *Expected RTW date* are entered.

Once the case type has been created, information can be updated as needed or used to link to other encounter visits or documents.

## Plan Narrative Section

## Reports

## Employee Portal  

  
### Request Leave of Absence  


Employees may submit a request for leave of absence via the employee portal (if configured) by completing a **Request Leave of Absence** questionnaire/form. Employees are asked appropriate questions based on the type of leave being requested. Data from the questionnaire can be programmed to flow in the Absence Management encounter. Once the employee completes the questionnaire it is tasked to the Absence Management Department for review.
