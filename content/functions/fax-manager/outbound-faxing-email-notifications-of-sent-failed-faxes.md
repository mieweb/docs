You can have {{% system-name %}} send you an email notifying you upon each successful sent fax you did and/or each failed (unsuccessful) fax that you sent via {{% system-name %}} . This is a user preference and only affects you, the logged in user.  
Please make sure you have your email entered in your username screen (a superuser may need to verify this or add this for you within your practice). You can always view the Fax Manager tab to view failed and successful faxes, but the email notification sends you an email instantly to you when the fax has been sent or has a problem being sent.

Your {{% system-name %}} system for your practice also must have two system settings turned on. These are on by default, but your MIE Implementer can turn off this email notification feature entirely for your entire practice.

The next item to have set is your *MY SETTINGS* preference for *Send Fax Notifications*. It is set to â€˜Both' by default. You can leave it as both or change it to which notification you want to receive via email for the fax sent. Most users set theirs to only receive email notifications for their failed faxes. This is a preference for you, the logged in user, and doesn't affect anyone else. Make sure you have your email address entered in your username screen.

* <strong>Both:</strong> You will receive an email notification each time your fax is successfully sent and you will also receive email notification each time a fax you send is unsuccessful.
* <strong>Send:</strong> You will only receive an email notification every time a fax you send is successful.
* <strong>Failed:</strong> You will only receive an email notification any time a fax you sent is unsuccessful (fails to go through).
* <strong>None:</strong> You will not receive any email notifications for any faxes you sent being successful or unsuccessful faxes.
After the above settings are done, you are all set and will begin receiving email notifications upon successful and/or failed faxes you sent from {{% system-name %}} .
  
## Email Notifications  
  
Below are examples of the emails that will come to you and how they will appear with the default verbiage your system has. Your practice can request a customized email notification layout for successful or unsuccessful email verbiage. The below examples are the default emails that will be sent, however you can request a customized email notification layout from your MIE Implementer for successful and/or unsuccessful faxes.
  
### Successful Sent Fax  
  
This is the default email you will receive upon each **sent (successful) fax** if you are set to BOTH or SEND as the preference.  
Email is from *support@mieweb.com.* Please do not reply to this email. It is for notification purposes only.  
Subject line shows the name of the {{% system-name %}} system. Contents of the email show again the {{% system-name %}} system the fax was done in and who the fax was sent to.

### Unsuccessful Fax  
  
This is the default email you will receive upon each **failed (unsuccessful) fax** if you are set to BOTH or FAILED as the preference.  
Email is from *support@mieweb.com.* Please do not reply to this email. It is for notification purposes only.  
Subject line shows the name of the {{% system-name %}} system. Contents of the email show again the {{% system-name %}} system the fax was done in and the email says why it was unsuccessful. The user can also click the underlined link in the email to view the fax itself right from there.
