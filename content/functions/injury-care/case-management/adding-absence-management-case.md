A case is a full report of a workplace injury or an incident involving an employee (patient). The case is usually created in an initial visit (encounter) with the patient, and is then linked to subsequent visits. A case links all follow-up visits (encounters), restrictions, accommodations, conditions, and nature of injury information. All of the documents pertaining to the case are grouped together within the chart for reporting purposes.  
{{% info %}}

The terms *case* and *incident* may be used interchangeably throughout the system.
{{% /info %}}
There are several case types, which designate different required fields as well as state-specific questions and forms.  {{% system-name %}} provides the ability to track absences as well as link any related documents or subsequent encounter documentation to a specific Absence Management case, as needed.  
  
## **Add New Absence Management Case**  

This help documentation is designed to assist in creating and documenting an Absence Management case type.  Some workflows use various documents or various encounters and may need to be linked to an Absence Management Case for tracking. 
By default, the Case section of encounters will display the following case types:
* Injury (OSHA Standard) 
* Injury (Non-OSHA Standard) 
* Hospital, Absence Management 
* Medical Suitability for Expatriate Assignment (MSEA)
* Medical Surveillance

If you wish to document a new case, click the header or **Edit** (Pencil) icon of the **Case** section in the dynamic encounter.

Once the **Case** section is expanded, indicate which type of case to create on the chart by selecting the appropriate radio button. The type of case selected will determine other fields or radio button data to complete. Once you open/create a case, any documentation, encounter visit documentations, or the like can be linked to a specific case/incident the chart has had previously documented.
  
## **Absence Management Case Details**  

After selecting to create an Absence Management case type, subsequent data fields branch open for documenting.  There are 2 required fields to capture before the system will save an Absence Management case to the chart. These are indicated by red asterisks. The other fields are optional and will most likely be keyed in at a later time, when managing the case throughout its life cycle.

### **Work Status (or Lost Time) Section**  

Lost time would be documented using the Restrictions and Accommodations section.  Refer to the [Restrictions and Accommodations](../adding-restrictions-and-accommodations.md) help documentation for more information.
  
### **Restrictions and Accommodations**  

Refer to help documentation named [Restrictions and Accommodations](../adding-restrictions-and-accommodations.md).
  
## **Linking Documents to Cases**  

Documents can be linked to cases.  This can be done via the **Edit Properties** of an existing stored document.  Documents can also be linked to cases when indexing from WebScan. Scheduled appointments can also be linked to cases when in the Add Appointment wizard, if necessary.
