A case is a full report of a workplace injury or an incident involving an employee (patient). The case is usually created in an initial visit (encounter) with the patient, and is then linked to subsequent visits. A case links all follow-up visits (encounters), restrictions, accommodations, conditions, and nature of injury information. All of the documents pertaining to the case are grouped together within the chart for reporting purposes.

The terms *case* and *incident* may be used interchangeably throughout the system.

There are several case types, which designate different required fields as well as state-specific questions and forms.  {{% system-name %}} provides the ability to track an employee and their dependents for an expatriate assignment by way of the Medical Suitability for Expatriate Assignment (MSEA) case type. All of the documents pertaining to the case are grouped together within the chart for reporting purposes.

## Add New MSEA Case

This help documentation is designed to assist with creating and documenting a MSEA case type. This case type is intended for tracking those employees and their family members that are assigned to reside in another country for work. Some workflows use various documents or various encounters and may need to be linked to a specific MSEA case for tracking.

By default, the Case section of encounters will display the following case types:


* Injury (OSHA Standard) 
* Injury (Non-OSHA Standard) 
* Hospital, Absence Management 
* Medical Suitability for Expatriate Assignment (MSEA)
* Medical Surveillance

If you wish to document a new case, click the header or **Edit** (Pencil) icon of the **Case** section in the dynamic encounter.

Once the **Case** section is expanded, indicate which type of case to create on the chart by selecting the appropriate radio button. The type of case selected will determine other fields or radio button data to complete. Once you open/create a case, any documentation, encounter visit documentations, or the like can be linked to a specific case/incident the chart has had previously documented.

## MSEA Case Details

After selecting to create a MSEA case type, the only field that expands is the **Date and time** field, which is required as noted by the red asterisk, and is meant for documenting the onset date and time of the case/incident.
