## **Cases**  
  
A Case is a full report of a workplace injury, or incident, for an employee (patient). The case is created in an initial visit (encounter), and is then linked to subsequent visits. A case links all follow up visits (encounters), restrictions, accommodations, conditions, and nature of injury information. All of the documents pertaining to the case are grouped together within the chart for reporting purposes. There are several case types, which designate different required fields as well as state specific incident questions and forms. The terms case and incident may be used interchangeably in a system.
  
### **Closing a Case from a Dynamic Encounter**  
  
The dynamic encounters offer a Case section.  To see the listing of cases/incidents a chart has while working in an encounter, you must expand the Case section in the encounter.

When expanded, the Case section lists any open case types the chart has existing so the encounter can be linked to an existing case, or offers the ability to create a new case if needed.  This is the summary to track cases (incidents), injuries, specific types (like MSEA or absence management) etc on the patient. From this listing of cases, in the options column you can close a case.  
A case (incident) should be closed if the case is entirely completed and considered closed by your work comp carrier or TPA.  If you have a bidirectional interface to your carrier, they may send a flag in the message that automatically closes the case on the {{% system-name %}} side if a carrier is involved in that case type.  Otherwise, it is a manual process.  
Closing a case is separate/different than closing & archiving an encounter.  A "case" can be open for weeks to months to years. It's the one case/incident that multiple documents and encounters may be tied to.  
To close a case when working in an encounter is done by clicking the Close hyperlink found in the options column of the listed cases the chart has on it.

{{% note %}}

If your preference to show closed cases is enabled, closed cases will also be listed in the Case section of an encounter.  Closed cases will not offer the ‘close' link since they are already closed. The closed case can however be reopened when working in the encounter.

A pop-up window will display to key in the date this case is considered closed entirely. Then click the Close button.

The date indicated as the close date will be displayed in the case section listing in the Conculsion Date column.  Notice also, that the close hyperlink is no longer available since you have already closed a specified case.

### **Closing a Case from the Cases Chart Tab**  

You can also close a case from the Cases chart tab when working in a chart.  The Cases chart tab lists all cases for the chart.  This chart tab shows any and all open and closed cases.  It does not show any deleted cases. There is a "show/hide closed" button that will show or hide closed cases from your view based on your preference.

{{% info %}}

Documents can be linked to closed cases in various modules of  {{% system-name %}} (encounters, indexing, document properties, etc), but it is not recommended unless it's some older documentation that wasn't linked previously.  Otherwise, a case should always remain open until known to officially consider it closed and with your carrier if one is involved.
