Patient or Employee charts can be manually registered into the system.

To do this, click the *E-Chart* tab from the left sidebar menu then find and click *Patient Registration* tab at the top.

**The required 4 fields are Last Name, First Name, Birthdate, and Organization** in order to manually register a chart into the system.  The other fields offered are optional.

While entering at least the required fields, the system will do a preliminary search and see if the patient exists after typing in the Last Name and First Name. If the system preliminarily finds a close match of existing charts based on the fields you entered, it will show those possible **Matching Charts** in a red section. These are possible matches of patients already entered in your system. You may want to double check that the patient already exists in {{% system-name %}} from this search result. This helps eliminate entering duplicate charts from being registered into the system.

If a possible Matching Chart is indeed the one to use and not register a new/duplicate one, simply select an existing patient record from the list of matching patients on the screen.

Otherwise, continue on with the registration/adding process for the patient chart wanting to register and then click the *Add New* button to add the patient chart to the system.

**NOTE:** if you are a user who is â€˜restricted by partition' and you attempt to register a chart to an organization whose partition is restricted, you will not be able to manually register the chart.  You must have permission to the partition that the organization is set to register patient charts to, in order to successfully register patient charts to the system.

If the patient chart has successfully been registered to the system, you will be advanced into the chart to the *Demographics* chart tab, where you can further enter demographic information in sections.
