When working in any encounter, there is a *Presenting Restrictions* encounter section available.  By default, this lists all presenting restrictions along with any accommodations in a summary format and is security permission dependent.

The presenting restrictions displayed in this section are active, current restrictions that are valid as of today's logged in date.  This section is for visibility purposes to quickly see any active restrictions a chart has when working in an encounter exam.

If you do not have security permission to at least View for the Manage Restr and Accom, you will see a statement that you lack permission to view restrictions in this section and throughout the chart.
