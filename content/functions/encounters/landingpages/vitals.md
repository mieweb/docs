Vital signs not only assist in early detection of potential problems, they aid in the monitoring and maintenance of ongoing medical conditions. The Vital Signs layout allows {{% system-name %}} users to view and add measurements of a patient's essential body functions. Whether it is from within the Vitals chart tab or within the  encounter, the body's most basic functions can be measured and recorded, quickly and easily.

Please visit the [Vitals Tracking & Management page](../../order-and-result-management/vitals-tracking-and-management.md) for information regarding Vitals.
