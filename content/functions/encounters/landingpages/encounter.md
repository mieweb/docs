When working in any encounter, the first section is the Encounter section.

The Encounter section houses chart identifiers, the date of service, the type of encounter & document name the encounter will store as upon close & archive, the encounter visit location, provider of service, the Employer organization and Payer.

It is important to always expand open this Encounter section to set the correct data for the overall encounter and its properties.  To expand open the section, simply click anywhere on the grey Encounter section title bar.

The system setting for "Use Charts" is enabled (by default), therefore the Provider field input in the Encounter  section will be a provider autocomplete. The autocomplete field then points to Provider charts that are linked to specific locations (provider org charts) that are configured for the system.  Search and select the specific provider and at which location that the service is being performed as within this autocomplete.  NOTE: For other types of systems, the Provider field may be a drop-down of provider users in the Physicians department (Physician Realm system setting default value).

Employer and Payer can be set to identify which employer organization this chart's encounter will be tied to.

The Archive As field is a set of drop-down choices that the specific encounter visit type (that you are working in) is allowed to be selected to archive as.  Archive As choices are configured within the Encounter Types editor of the Control Panel.

To close the section, simply click anywhere on the grey title bar again or click the Next or Save icon at the bottom of the section.  NOTE: The entire encounter outline will refresh automatically when this section is closed and saved.  This is on purpose because the rest of the encounter depends on what Visit type is set here and other fields.
