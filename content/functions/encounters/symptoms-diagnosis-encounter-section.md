The Symptoms/Diagnosis is an optional encounter section that is displayed in the Assessment grouping of the Visit Encounter. The Symptoms/Diagnosis section is similar to the Smart Plan encounter section, however, Smart Plan is located at the top of the encounter and it is intended to be a combination of both the Assessment and Plan sections.

![](../symptoms-diagnosis-encounter-section.assets/be3e2b2387a46b241afc64fba503aa52.png)

Providers will use the Quick List (right side of the blue vertical bar) to populate the Symptoms/Diagnosis section with conditions and orders for today's visit (left side of the blue vertical bar). Providers can leverage a combination of features, such as pre-configured libraries, pre-populated data based on existing data in the patient chart and/or database, organize conditions, as well as quickly order and perform tests, add procedures, and manage medications from the Symptoms/Diagnosis.
