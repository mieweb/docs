Within an encounter, there is a Gynecology History section that can be utilized.  There, within the encounter, a chart's gynecology history can be recorded or updated.

Use the free text fields, speech to text dictation icon, or use the previous value quick text or library macros on the far right to quickly get the Gynecology History documented.

### Gynecology History - Flowsheet

The gynecology history encounter section can instead point to a specific flowsheet configured in the system.  A configured flowsheet named *Gynecology History* in the flowsheet editor will display in the encounter Gynecology History section if desired.  Using a Gynecology History flowsheet allows your system to capture unique or custom information for your practice to document in an encounter within the Gynecology History encounter section.

To utilize a flowsheet method in Gynecology History, a flowsheet named *Gynecology History* must exist with contents.

## Delete / Edit / View Gynecology History Captured Data

You can edit, delete, add to, or view the specific documented Gynecology History data from the encounter section.

### Hover Options

Once Gynecology History data has been documented, one can edit, add to, or delete data for the specific Gynecology History data that was captured.  If you do not have security permission to edit or add to observations, then you will not be able to.

From the section's collapsed summary view, simply click on the values/data of the specific Gynecology History line item to edit on or add to.  The data will be displayed in a border box where you can begin modifying or typing in more information.

Also while the encounter section is in summary collapsed view, icon options next to the stored data will display.

**Trash Can icon:** will immediately delete the stored data for the gynecology history line item.  Gynecology history data stores as observations.  If you do not have security permission to delete observations, the trashcan icon will still display, but upon click, the system will not allow the data to be deleted.

**Eyeball icon:** will pop-up the View Observation window to view more specific details of the specific gynecology history data. Revisions, trending, and entry information will be seen. Gynecology History data stores as observations.

### Expanded Encounter Section

Gynecology History data can also be edited on, added to, or cleared/deleted from the expanded encounter summary section.  Once Gynecology History data has been documented, the encounter section can be expanded open by clicking anywhere on the grey title section bar.  Then, the data can be clicked to edit & add to, or can click X to clear the data out of the field.  If you do not have security permission to edit or delete observations, the system will not allow you to modify.

## Gynecology History Summary Dashboard Portlet

Gynecology History data stores as observations within the chart.  Most recent recorded gynecology history is also visible within a portlet on the Summary chart tab dashboard.

Gynecology History can be updated from the portlet by using the pencil icon.

That then opens the separate chart tab *Past Medical History* where the Gynecology History section is offered.  Clicking the grey title bar area (like within an encounter section behavior) is where the gynecology history fields will open for recording data or updating data.
