Within an encounter, there is a Social History section that can be utilized.  There, within the encounter, a chart's social history can be recorded or updated.

To record or edit Social History information within the encounter, simply click anywhere on the Social History grey title section area to expand open that section.

Use the free text fields, speech to text dictation icon, or use the previous value quick text or library macros on the far right to quickly get the Social History documented.

NOTE: Social History fields (when in expanded mode) reflect any chief complaint protocol(s) selected.  Otherwise, if no chief complaint protocol is designated on the encounter, the Social History section will default to offering our standard Social History questions configured within the Social History flowsheet.  For more information on chief complaint protocols, please see separate guide [Encounter Protocols](encounter-protocols.md).

### Social History - Flowsheet

The social history encounter section can instead point to a specific flowsheet configured in the system.  A configured flowsheet named *Social History* in the flowsheet editor will display in the encounter Social History section if desired.  Using a Social History flowsheet allows your system to capture unique or custom information for your practice to document in an encounter within the Social History encounter section.

To utilize a flowsheet method in Social History, a flowsheet named *Social History* must exist with contents.

## Social History Summary Dashboard Portlet

Social History data stores as observations within the chart.  Most recent recorded social history is also visible within a portlet on the Summary chart tab dashboard.

Social History can be updated from the portlet by using the pencil icon.

That then opens the separate chart tab *Social History* where the grey title bar area can be clicked (like within an encounter section behavior) where the social history fields will open for recording data or updating data.
