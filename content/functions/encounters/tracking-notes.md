## Delete / Edit / View Tracking Notes Captured Data

The Tracking Notes section allows you to view existing documented Tracking Notes on that encounter, or allows you to delete an existing documented Tracking Note (security permission dependent).  Once a Tracking Note has been documented and saved, an edit to it cannot be made.

### View Existing Tracking Notes

The Tracking Notes section displays any existing historical notes someone has keyed in (along with a date/time stamp) and stores as observations on the chart.  These Tracking Notes stay with the specific encounter and are not shared in any other separate encounters the chart may have now or in the future.

Notes in this section display with most recently dated at the top.

### Delete an Existing Tracking Note

You can delete existing Tracking Notes entirely off the encounter section (and thus it deletes the stored observation) if you have security permission to delete observations.

Simply expand open the Tracking Notes encounter section and click the minus - button in the options column of the specific Tracking Note wish to delete.

Once the minus - button is clicked, it will put a strikethrough the entire Note selected.  This signifies it will delete this note off once you SAVE the section.  If you made a mistake, you can click the *add* button in the options column (where the minus button was before you clicked it) and the note will have the strikethrough removed and won't be deleted.

However, once you SAVE the encounter section (by clicking the ‘next' button or the ‘save' icon or collapsing the encounter section), your work is saved and if you had deleted a note, there is no way to bring it back.
