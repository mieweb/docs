In the *Dictation* tab pending screen:  
If the Physician used the phone to dictate or the general add dict link in the *Dictation* module (and not in a specific patient's E-Chart), it will **not** show patient's name or DOB.  
If the Physician used the SpeechMike or microphone into {{% system-name %}} directly and in the specific patient's E-Chart, it **will** show patient's name & DOB.

## Transcribe Dictation (No Patient Name Identifier)  
  
Log into {{% system-name %}} and click on *Dictation* tab on left sidebar menu.  
The screen will open to the *All Pending* tab of dictation jobs to do that are *unassigned*. By default, you view only unassigned dictation files. To view All Pending or your Assigned Pending, click on the underlined Assigned or All link right under that chart tab name at the top.
  
![](../basic-transcription-all-users.assets/1000000000000496000000BD0B56493F23FB21CF.png)  

If you wish to grab an unassigned dictation to do, simply click grab. If you wish to assign dictation to someone then use the Select buttons below the list of unassigned dictation (see other instruction pages).  
Click Assigned to view the dictation assigned to your username. This is the same view as My Pending tab.  
To work on a dictation:  
Click *[Grab Next Job]* towards the middle top of the screen. Or grab next to the specific individual job in Dictation ID that you want to do. This locks the job to you, so no one else can work on the same patient.  
{{% note %}}

The jobs that were phoned in dictation or generic dictation without being tagged to a patient will **not** have patient names in those columns.
{{% /note %}}
  
![](../basic-transcription-all-users.assets/10000000000004DC00000105F100F635E189FE16.png)  

The MIEPlayer box will pop-up and automatically start playing. (Unless you have set the *config* to not automatically start playing each dictation. See instructions on next page.)
  
![](../basic-transcription-all-users.assets/100000000000016300000122397E5C9D42AFBF22.png)  

Listen to the dictation and then hit stop after the doctor dictates the patient name or MR#. You can search by patient's name by typing in the last name of the patient and the field will auto-complete and give you patient choices w/ that name. Select the patient from the drop-down choices. Or you can search by birthdate or MR#, etc. (Click the help icon for other search methods).
After you select a patient for this dictation to be linked to, it will say UNDO next to the patient's name. Click this if you selected the wrong patient.
  
![](../basic-transcription-all-users.assets/100000000000016C0000012410C9EF21E6A5F561.png)  

Now that you have specified the dictation to a patient's file, click *add doc* link next to the patient's name. If the *Job Type* is already specified, that particular document tied to that job type will open after you click add doc.
Choose your template type if there is a choice (word, text, etc type of document).
{{% info %}}

If there is no job type specified in the dictation, when you click add doc you will be taken to the Add Document screen and you can select which document type needs to be opened and transcribed into for this dictation.
{{% /info %}}
Fill out the box of information of service date & location and click *Submit*.
Then it opens the template. Click on MIEPlayer again to start playing the dictation. Start typing in the template
There is also an add enc link next to the add doc link. The add enc link will only show if there is ajob type for the dictation and if there is an encounter visit type associated with the job type.
*CONFIG:*
If you **right click** on the MIEPlayer in the red/beige area right above the "faster/slower" and scroll to click on *Config.*
  
![](../basic-transcription-all-users.assets/100000000000017A0000012669A6AD9A8A8FDA7D.png)  

  
![](../basic-transcription-all-users.assets/100000000000013500000218F7D736D4B3C85BBD.png)  

There is a box where you can enter the number of seconds you would like to "backup how many seconds on stop". You can then set it for 2 or 3 seconds so that when you hit stop, you can auto-rewind when starting. To make the MIEPlayer **not** play the dictation automatically when grabbed/opened, there is an option to make it not automatically play. Un-checkmark the box next to *Automatic Play* then click the OK box. If this is un-checkmarked, then each time you grab/open a dictation, it will not play automatically. You would initiate play by hitting the foot pedal or using the mouse to click Play on the MIEPlayer.
Jobs do not auto-complete unless you use the ‘grab' or ‘grab next job' option. If you do not use the ‘grab' option, you must click on **edit** next to each job and change to *completed.*
  
![](../basic-transcription-all-users.assets/100000000000015100000113581EEAA919E8064F.png)  

When you are done with the dictation in the MIEPlayer, click any of the following options:
* <strong>Pending</strong>: When you have grabbed a job, it marks it with your user id, then if you click Pending, it will put it in the Pending tab.
* <strong>Complete</strong>: Marks it completed and places it in the Completed tab.
* <strong>Continue</strong>: Marks the one you are working in as Completed and then grabs the next job that is in order.
If you just X out and close the MIEPlayer without selecting any of these status' then it will automatically put it in the ‘In Progress' dictation tab. It is still considered open. It says in red towards the top "You have job #### marked in progress'. It will stay in the IN PROGRESS tab forever until you go back in and move it to the correct status.
To move it: Go to IN PROGRESS tab and find your job. Click on edit next to the job you want to move in Dictation ID column. Find the field called *STATUS* and use the drop-down arrow box to select the correct status to move this dictation. Click *MODIFY* when done. It will then move it where you specified.
  
![](../basic-transcription-all-users.assets/100000000000036C0000019CA0E4BCA5BE40A527.png)  

  
## Transcribe Dictation (Birthdate Identifier But No Patient Name Identifier)  

If you grab a dictation that has a birthdate entered, but no patient name, it will show the patient's birthdate in the *last,first name* column in the dictation pending queue. This means whoever did the dictation did not dictate within the specific patient's chart, or they didn't search and attach a patient's name, they just entered the patient's birthdate.
It is up to you now to find the specific patient after you grab the dictation.
  
![](../basic-transcription-all-users.assets/100000000000048300000073F707576A7FF90757.png)  

After you grab the dictation, you will see the MIE Player window open. It will begin playing the dictation. You can stop it so you can work on the patient identifier.
In the **Patient** field you will see ex: #09081929. This is the birthdate of the patient. It is not an mr# or any other kind of number.
  
![](../basic-transcription-all-users.assets/100000000000016F00000122DC356C374F5093B4.png)  

Simply place your mouse on the patient field (where the birthdate is entered) and click one time. It will then pop-up a list of patient's w/ that matching birthdate. You can then select the appropriate patient by clicking on the patient's name from the drop-down list of choices.
As soon as you do that, it will insert the patient's name into the patient field and have the choice UNDO next to it.
If you have selected the wrong patient for this dictation, simply click UNDO and it will clear the field and you will have to search by birth date or name manually for this patient's dictation.
Continue to listen to dictation, add/upload a document and complete the dictation.
  
![](../basic-transcription-all-users.assets/100000000000016C0000012410C9EF21E6A5F561.png)

![](../basic-transcription-all-users.assets/1000000000000496000000BD0B56493F23FB21CF.png)  

If you wish to grab an unassigned dictation to do, simply click grab. If you wish to assign dictation to someone then use the Select buttons below the list of unassigned dictation (see other instruction pages).

To work on a dictation:
Click *[Grab Next Job]* towards the middle top of the screen. Or grab next to the specific individual job in Dictation ID that you want to do. This locks the job to you, so no one else can work on the same patient.
The MIEPlayer box will pop-up and automatically start playing. (Unless you have set the *config* to not automatically start playing each dictation. See instructions in next paragraph.)
The patient's name will be displayed along with *add doc* next to the name.
Click *add doc* link there and it will pop-up the word template that is set to be used for this dictation. This was set when the user selected the job type when dictating. Click on MIEPlayer again to start playing the dictation. Start typing in the template.
  
![](../basic-transcription-all-users.assets/100000000000015100000111A0942AC1EA30B8CA.png)

#### Config  

If you **right click** on the MIEPlayer in the grey area right above the "faster/slower" and scroll to click on *config*, **(See previous pages)** there is a box where you can enter the number of seconds you would like to "backup how many seconds on stop". You can then set it for 2 or 3 seconds so that when you hit stop, you can auto-rewind when starting. To make the MIEPlayer **not** play the dictation automatically when grabbed/opened, there is an option to make it not automatically play. Un-checkmark the box next to *Automatic Play* then click the OK box. If this is un-checkmarked, then each time you grab/open a dictation, it will not play automatically. You would initiate play by hitting the foot pedal or using the mouse to click Play on the MIEPlayer.
Jobs do not auto-complete unless you use the ‘grab' or ‘grab next job' option. If you do not use the ‘grab' option, you must click on *edit* next to each job and change to *completed.*
When you are done with the dictation in the MIEPlayer, click any of the following options:
* <strong>Pending</strong>: When you have grabbed a job, it marks it with your user id, then if you click Pending, it will put it in the Pending tab.
* <strong>Complete</strong>: Marks it completed and places it in the Completed tab.
* <strong>Continue</strong>: Marks the one you are working in as Completed and then grabs the next job that is in order.
* <strong>Archive & Close Encounter</strong>: If doing encounter dictation, when done typing you can close & archive the encounter so the physician is saved a step. Then click the close button on the MIE player window.
If you just X out and close the MIEPlayer without selecting any of these status' then it will automatically put it in the ‘In Progress' dictation tab. It is still considered open. Please make sure to click the close or complete or done link when all done.
Upload your word template you have typed into.
  
#### Hot-keys  

These work when you have grabbed the next job from the dictation queue and are in the MIEPlayer.
Instead of using your computer mouse to click Pending, Complete or Continue, you can use these keyboard buttons:
* Alt-g then enter = Grab next job (this marks the one you are currently in as completed)
* Alt-c then enter = Continue
* Alt-p then enter = Pending
  
## Releasing a Grabbed Job  

You can release a job that you grabbed (prior to completing it) and it will be put back into the pending queue for anyone to grab & complete.
Simply find the dictation job id# that you grabbed in the IN PROGRESS tab.
Click edit to open that dictation job.
In the **Transcriber** field, it will say your username. Click **(release job)** link and it will release this job that you grabbed.
  
![](../basic-transcription-all-users.assets/100000000000036C0000019CA0E4BCA5BE40A527.png)  

It will release the job (put it back into the pending queue) and will display a confirmation message that the dictation was successfully released.
  
![](../basic-transcription-all-users.assets/10000000000003060000004A809A5C50C049A111.png)  

  
## Dictation All Pending Tab  

You must have security permission to access the All Pending tab. The All Pending tab shows all pending dictation jobs. This tab gives you the link options to view all pending dictation that is Assigned, Unassigned, or all (every pending) dictation. You will see the links to view assigned, unassigned, all dictation at the top left corner of that opened tab.
  
![](../basic-transcription-all-users.assets/100000000000037E000000892983FF27EABDB79F.png)  

If you do not have security permission to view the All Pending tab, that tab will not show up in your view.
If you have permission to view the All Pending tab, but do not have the link options available, then you do not have permission to the next security setting for this tab named Show All/Unassigned dictation jobs.
That is another security permission that would need set.
If you do not have permission to view all & unassigned dictation jobs, the ALL PENDING dictation tab will show *only your assigned* dictation jobs. You do not have access to view any other jobs in the ALL PENDING queue. You either grab the jobs assigned to you or you click the Grab Next Job link to grab a dictation in the queue (but you can't see it on your screen as pending.) You can see the total # of dictation jobs that are pending in the ALL PENDING tab name, but you cannot view the specifics of these jobs on your screen.
These above settings are for clients who are concerned about users selecting only certain dictation jobs to pick & choose to do.
  
![](../basic-transcription-all-users.assets/1000000000000385000000F20B65CD73ACB24CD5.png)  

The dictation Show All/ Unassigned security permission also affects the My Pending tab.  Usually in My Pending you, by default, can see assigned jobs but you can also jump to unassigned and all jobs by clicking on the links. The new security right takes away to view all jobs other than those assigned to you. You are only viewing your assigned jobs. To do a job in the pending queue that is not specifically assigned to you, you would click grab next job.
You can checkmark to select specific pending dictation jobs and assign them out. To do this, checkmark the specific Dictation ID's and then go to the bottom and select the person in the *Assign Selected To* drop-down. Then click the ASSIGN button. Any user who is tagged as a member of the transcription department will show in this drop-down as able to assign to.
  
![](../basic-transcription-all-users.assets/10000000000003810000011696ED56F066AAF8D3.png)  

  
## Dictation Incomplete Tab  

This is only available for point & click exam dictation, not regular dictations.
There is an incomplete tab in the dictation tab. This is a security permission to view/access this.
When transcribing from a point and click exam, some dictation may be inaudible or have questions regarding the dictation. The user/transcriber can then click an inaudible button to put it in the *incomplete* tab and the transcription supervisor can then review their work and make any changes or user can task the provider for clarification and keep the dictation marked in this incomplete tab until then. Another workflow could be for the transcriptionist to make preliminary archive. This creates a document that would be sent to esign (make sure esign rules are set up). The physician would review the document in his/her esign and see the **inaudible** marking on the document, then he/she would reject the document and type his update in the rejection section. The rejected esign then is tasked back to the transcriptionist (this is default {{% system-name %}} functionality). The transcriptionist then would go back into the dictation and update it, then archive and close, which would then again send the completed document back to the physicians esign queue. When a dictation job is marked as "incomplete/inaudible" it releases it from being assigned to the transcriptionist.

## Dictation Held Tab  

Any encounter dictation is ‘Held by the Dictator' until the encounter exam is submitted. Systems can be setup to have a "Save Exam" and a "Save and Release to Transcription" button, in which case all voice files are held until save and release is clicked. This ‘held' tab shows held dictations that a physician (dictator) is working on or wants to edit within an encounter exam. The transcriptionist cannot grab the dictation job until the physician releases his dictation.
  
![](../basic-transcription-all-users.assets/1000000000000386000000AD291A8C10AA530255.png)  

  
## Dictation Completed Tab  

This tab shows the last 4 weeks worth of completed dictations (dictations jobs marked as ‘complete'). It's limited to the last 4 weeks worth in order to improve the speed that the tab opens. If anything beyond that is needed, the search tab should be used.
  
![](../basic-transcription-all-users.assets/100000000000037C000000D10191EDDE525FFB0F.png)
