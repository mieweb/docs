When working in any encounter, there is a *Questionnaire* encounter section available.  By default, this lists any stored questionnaires (mapped to the Health Questionnaires chart tab) with a date of service within the past 60 days of today's logged in session. You can review stored questionnaires while working in an encounter.  Prior stored/submitted questionnaires may be applicable to the visit which you are working in.

By default, any questionnaire documents are in a list view.  If you like working your encounters with the Questionnaires expanded as Detail View (to see entire contents of the questionnaire document within the encounter), simply click the *Detail View* box icon.

![](../questionnaire-encounter-section.assets/6f2ed0124cd363c48d3e0a802a77a4d6.png)

This will expand each questionnaire (currently listed in that encounter section) into Detail View mode within the encounter screen.  You are able to see the questionnaire stored document within the encounter section, without having to browse out or open it in another window/tab.  Questionnaires listed in this section are stored documents, so you are viewing the document in Detail View.

![](../questionnaire-encounter-section.assets/aa98c7490b45bfa13eca891f1d2ace12.png)

At the end of a detail view questionnaire, you will see **Hide/Show Tasks**.  You can scroll to the end of each stored questionnaire to read the completed task notes that the clinician wrote when initially reviewing the questionnaire from the received task back when the questionnaire was submitted.  *Note: there is a My Settings preference to always have the system expand the tasks linked to documents as ‘show task' if wish to have that default.  The preference is: Expand Task in Document View*

![](../questionnaire-encounter-section.assets/10c72a9fbb365d849437409f5bbde066.png)

When you click Hide/Show Tasks, it will show the task details that are linked (if applicable) to the stored/submitted questionnaire document.  You can see who/when completed the initial questionnaire review task, and see any completed task notes if the initial reviewer (who completed/marked done the linked task) entered any.

## Link with Interpretation

Jumping back up to the stored questionnaire document in Detail View, you can hover your mouse (or swipe left if on an ipad or touchscreen detected device) at the top left of the stored questionnaire document details to see icons. The **Link with Interpretation** is an available icon.  **Link with Interpretation** will link this selected stored questionnaire document to the encounter you are working in (meaning, this stored questionnaire document that is listed, will be linked to the encounter being worked in and noted as such in the *Linked Documents* separate encounter section).  Anything in the *Linked Document* section is also visibly noted on the closed/archived encounter document.  However, the **Linked with Interpretation** will also allow the user to key in an interpretation regarding the selected questionnaire.  Any interpretation notes will also be visible in the Linked Documents separate encounter section within the view and also within the closed/archived encounter document.

![](../questionnaire-encounter-section.assets/e346917b8caa95a002e8b7b68948d608.png)

Link with Interpretation icon will open a free text Notes pop-up window to free type in any Interpretation or Analysis of the stored questionnaire document selected.

![](../questionnaire-encounter-section.assets/20a068ce719ff919d0c1d7cc320aa152.png)

Once done keying in an Interpretation or Analysis regarding the selected questionnaire document being reviewed, simply click the SUBMIT button within the pop-up.

![](../questionnaire-encounter-section.assets/9a3172ba867dd02605b6b0ad18247f4e.png)

Upon submit, the selected questionnaire will be *linked* to the encounter being worked in (is listed as a Linked Document in that separate encounter section) **and** any Interpretation notes are also bulleted under the linked questionnaire document selected.   *Note: when using the Link with Interpretation method, the selected questionnaire and interpretation do indeed get linked to the encounter being worked in.  However, to see it in the Linked Documents encounter section in real-time, you may have to refresh the screen or click on the grey title bar of the Linked Documents section.  When you Link with Interpretation, the system doesn't automatically refresh the page/screen or section.*

### Add another Interpretation

After a selected questionnaire stored document is linked to the encounter you are working in (and has an interpretation), you are able to add more than one interpretation.  Perhaps you need to add another interpretation or another provider is now seeing the colleague and needs to add their interpretation. Once the stored questionnaire document is linked (and visible in the Linked Documents separate encounter section), there is an **_Add Interpretation_****** icon at the far right of the listed linked document in that section.

![](../questionnaire-encounter-section.assets/7a9066d90db2c7c582c33fa9df415dfb.png)

### Stored encounter document once closed & archived

If using the *Link with Interpretation* icon, once the encounter itself is finally closed & archived and made into a document that can be shared, the encounter document itself will have the selected Linked Documents listed (with the questionnaire/document titles and date of service), **and** Interpretations embedded and part of the encounter document itself.

![](../questionnaire-encounter-section.assets/660056de2491c375a154cca6d26d0931.png)

## Unlink from Encounter

If you made a mistake or change your mind and do not want the selected Questionnaire document to be linked to the encounter you are working in (nor the interpretation), you can use the *unlink icon* from the listed questionnaire within the Linked Documents encounter section.  If you hover over the linked document (or swipe left if on an ipad or touchscreen device), you will see the icons there and one is the ability to *unlink from encounter. *

![](../questionnaire-encounter-section.assets/34ddccad754c4e641b713275ce1ad454.png)

Clicking on the *Add Interpretation* icon will pop-open the Notes where you can visibly see any other linked interpretations and/or add another interpretation to it. You can even copy a prior interpretation into the free text box and continue to expand on it.

![](../questionnaire-encounter-section.assets/2864d1225d071fad4826b969fe282eb5.png)

Once you've submitted another interpretation, all interpretations will continue to be visible and bulleted under the encounter linked Questionnaire document in the Linked Documents section.  Linked documents with interpretations are part of the encounter document once closed & archived.

![](../questionnaire-encounter-section.assets/640b44c8e4650af585cbc4d76ce38af8.png)

## Add Details to Encounter

After linking a stored questionnaire document to the encounter you are working in, from the Linked Documents encounter section, you could also (optional) use the *Add Details to Encounter* icon.  This icon is available at the far right of the listed Linked Documents encounter section (again, if on an ipad or touchscreen device you would swipe left to see those icons)

![](../questionnaire-encounter-section.assets/e62ba95ce94a91f12e48ca84afd1e5d8.png)

The **Add Details to Encounter** icon will actually embed ALL the questionnaire document contents into the encounter being worked in.  So instead of just the questionnaire being linked and the title of the questionnaire being listed as linked (with interpretations), the entire questionnaire document CONTENTS (questions & answers and document details) gets embedded into the encounter being worked in.  Interpretations continue to be visible and are still part of the encounter being worked in.

![](../questionnaire-encounter-section.assets/06a0f463f3395de08e1fae6d7e15d545.png)

### Stored encounter document once closed & archived

If using the *Add Details to Encounter* icon, once the encounter itself is finally closed & archived and made into a document that can be shared, the encounter document itself will have the selected Linked Documents, Interpretations **and** the full questionnaire document contents (questions & answers) embedded and part of the encounter document itself.  Essentially a document within a document.

![](../questionnaire-encounter-section.assets/1413a9c5e545c61bf23c15551db4360b.png)

OR if you like to work/have your Questionnaire encounter section as list view, you can still review, add interpretation & link (with or without contents/details) to the encounter you are working in.

![](../questionnaire-encounter-section.assets/d2414698f87eda82b81e19ab4225cb98.png)

Open the questionnaire document in a separate screen using the northeast arrow icon

![](../questionnaire-encounter-section.assets/db62ab3ffb0d5a86254ab6d8bbb8ddf7.png)

Review the questionnaire in it's own screen (and initial task review completion notes at the end) and then link with Interpretation (and write interpretation notes).

![](../questionnaire-encounter-section.assets/dae7d55f502d5093387cabe4e6f5ae85.png)

And if you want the entire questionnaire w/ their answers also linked (embedded) in the encounter visit document, you can then click the ‘link with details' button.

![](../questionnaire-encounter-section.assets/c526fba637fa403cbf98d788be428f49.png)

Then X close out of that separate tab/browser window to be back in the encounter.

When you refresh the encounter you are working in (or wait until going to view and/or close & archive) you will see the linked questionnaire with interpretation and/or the detailed questionnaire contents (depending if you selected to link it with detail or not)

![](../questionnaire-encounter-section.assets/a75d767f3f5ff469eb852ba35c68f4cf.png)

## Interpretations Visibility

Once interpretations are keyed in and saved, interpretations are visible on the encounter entry side, on the encounter view side, and on the encounter stored/archived document (all stated above in this guide).

However, interpretations are also visible from within properties of an encounter.  Simply go to the Encounters stand-alone chart tab, find a specific encounter's Properties.

![](../questionnaire-encounter-section.assets/6a02b780e02118b132ad12543c338fe8.png)

Once in the properties of an encounter, in the *Links to Encounter* datavis section, any interpretations noted on an encounter document will be listed as a stored observation named *Object item interpretation.*

![](../questionnaire-encounter-section.assets/b56476237132c4eb9deafd82abb7a069.png)

Interpretations are also reportable from a report named Patient Observations from the Reports sidemenu tab.  In the Patient Observations report, simply put in a date range and search by observation name **Object Note Interpretation** on a mass report level system wide.

![](../questionnaire-encounter-section.assets/59536a6e93076bf6e144587be09c62db.png)

On an individual chart level, Interpretations can be reported on via the chart tab named Observations/Flowsheets.  From that chart tab, select the flowsheet from the drop-down named *Interpretations* (and any applicable date range if needed).  After clicking on the search button, you see any interpretations ever keyed in for that specific chart (and is listed by date/time of keyed in).
