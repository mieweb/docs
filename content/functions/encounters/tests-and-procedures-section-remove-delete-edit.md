The Tests & Procedures encounter section can be found in the Objective section.  This section mimics the stand alone "Due List" chart tab.  The Tests & Procedures section displays items that are "due" so when a patient comes in, and the staff is working in an encounter, the clinician has visibility of items that the patient is due for, here in this encounter section.  Note: These same items are also visible from the separate chart tab named Due List.   For more information on the Due List stand alone chart tab, please see [Due List](../health-surveillance/due-list.md) guide.

If the patient is due for any tests, questionnaires, or procedures, they are listed in the summary of this Tests & Procedures section.

![](../tests-and-procedures-section-remove-delete-edit.assets/22b85e854b4d834b6a832e8b8176cba8.png)

To see details of those pending tests or procedures on a patient's "due list" shown here in this section, simply click on the title bar of that section Tests & Procedures to expand the contents.

![](../tests-and-procedures-section-remove-delete-edit.assets/5f35058d0a706fd10d5008d27d3b3693.png)

The section expands to show a datavis of pending due list items in detail with order name, the due date, status, any applicable Health Surveillance panel it may be a part of, who ordered/triggered it, when it was ordered/triggered, etc.  The View Details hyperlink is also an available option to see more granular details of an individual pending item or procedure.

## Tests & Procedures Right Side Quick List Method

A banner or bookmark icon is located on the right side of the Tests & Procedures encounter section.  This can be clicked to expand open to utilize the right side quick list functionality for the Tests & Procedures section.

![](../tests-and-procedures-section-remove-delete-edit.assets/f1cb329414bbd19d04c64bb129d47e43.png)

## Managing Tests & Procedures

Hovering over the tests & procedures list will display options to help manage each existing pending due list item from the list view or from the right side quicklist method.

![](../tests-and-procedures-section-remove-delete-edit.assets/0e0320a4857b0ed09e71af74d3d99182.png)

Note: The My Settings Preference of "Show Dynamic List Options" controls on hover or as always.

![](../tests-and-procedures-section-remove-delete-edit.assets/8c01f50f5e34eb17ae1e017ad21a2689.png)

If this setting is changed to "Always", then all options in the encounter and/or other areas where icons are dynamic will display. This is typically discouraged and clients should be encouraged to use the hover.

Managing tests & procedures can also be managed in the detailed datavis by using the encounter section expand mode.  Simply click on the grey title section area to expand open the tests & procedures encounter section.

![](../tests-and-procedures-section-remove-delete-edit.assets/f3a3524a64487317ec4ff0d35591ea6b.png)

Items/procedures/tests are *pending* due for the patient/employee.  If the order item has a specific due date, the due date will also be visible. This will help you see what is due and if you want to go ahead and do those items on the patient today during the visit, or wait until a future visit closer to the due date. Note: any items (such as questionnaires being completed via the portal) are ‘in progress' and therefore will not be shown in the tests & procedures encounter section.  Written Opinions (RE order items) are also not shown in the tests & procedures encounter section.  Written Opinions (RE order items) are shown in their own Recommendations encounter section.

![](../tests-and-procedures-section-remove-delete-edit.assets/90e9d367dd3c52d3a0035ec8465dbf3e.png)

To remove, delete, or edit any of these existing pending items or any other pending procedure items while in today's encounter, one can quickly do that when the Tests & Procedures section is collapsed, using the right side quicklist method, or in expand datavis mode.  NOTE: For more information on how to add/perform/complete/result items, see separate guide [Tests & Procedures - Applying/Adding, Completing, Resulting](tests-and-procedures-section-applying-adding-completing-resulting.md).

## Delete Individually

There is the ability to completely delete a procedure item off of the pending due list when working in an encounter. Simply hover on the specific item from the list view or the right side quicklist area and click the *trash can* icon.

When you click the delete icon button for a specific selected procedure item(s) in the Tests & Procedures section, and the system saves your work, refreshes the encounter, opens you back up to the expanded Tests & Procedures section and that item(s) is removed from the pending due list.

The *Edit Orders* pop-up window will display.  It will tell you (in yellow) how many order items you selected that will be edited together.

* Simply change the <strong><em>Status</em></strong>' field to be deleted (using the drop-down options).

![](../tests-and-procedures-section-remove-delete-edit.assets/213a60c75ac93f6c5f78217ab40d0f05.png)

More details, regarding a deleted due list item, are available from the View Details hyperlink option also.

![](../tests-and-procedures-section-remove-delete-edit.assets/1b5c634f94a20511e9f5766f65ed3eb8.png)

### Status

If editing a pending due list item's *status*, choose a different status using the drop-down options.  For more detailed information and definitions on Status options, please see [Due List](../health-surveillance/due-list.md) guide.

![](../tests-and-procedures-section-remove-delete-edit.assets/a09abdc4fd0a57371623741bdf407953.png)

### Dates

The date fields within the Edit  Encounter Order screen are important.  For more detailed information and definitions on date fields, please see [Due List](../health-surveillance/due-list.md) guide.

* Due Date: is the date this pending order item is set to being due (typically configured at Health Surveillance Panel component level, but can be manually edited)
* Completed Date: Depending on the status type selected, a <em>Completed Date</em> field may appear and be prepopulated with today's date.  Completed date indicates the date the item is considered completed, or deleted, or waived, or declined, etc.
* Visible Date: is the date this pending order item is set to being visible (typically configured at Health Surveillance Panel component level, but can be manually edited)

TIP: We recommend the system setting *Treat Declined As Completed* stay enabled in the system by default.  As enabled, Health Surveillance will treat declined order items (when related to health surveillance panels) the same as normally completed ones for forecasting purposes. If this setting is disabled, declined order items (when related to health surveillance panels) will be treated the same as those not completed.

![](../tests-and-procedures-section-remove-delete-edit.assets/d49df7a2731a55571039dd39bf9ff71b.png)

### Comments

We recommend keying in comments as to why you are editing the status of a pending due list item also.  These comments will be visible on the item's revision history when the View Details option is utilized within the chart's due list stand alone chart tab.

### Decline Form

The Decline Form hyperlink will display if a pending due list item is changed to Declined status. For more detailed information on its purpose and functionality, please see [Due List](../health-surveillance/due-list.md) guide.

![](../tests-and-procedures-section-remove-delete-edit.assets/13d3e57d6b6c4dbaec16d9e3b61ffce9.png)

### Save Edit

Once you've saved your edit, the system saves your work, refreshes the encounter back in the Tests & Procedures section. You have visibility to edited due list items back in the stand alone Due List Chart Tab in the respective datavis section it falls in.

## Edit Multiple

There is the ability to edit multiple procedure items from the pending due list when working in an encounter. Simply expand open the Tests & Procedures encounter section by clicking anywhere on the grey title section area.

Next, checkmark the pending items you wish to edit.  Once the selected items are checkmarked, click the *Edit* action button.

![](../tests-and-procedures-section-remove-delete-edit.assets/5455f3b736a2e4fd3dd180941fa859fa.png)

The *Edit Orders* pop-up window will display.  It will tell you (in yellow) how many order items you selected that will be edited together:

Simply change the field(s) needed and set any date fields as needed.  The indicated edits will be applied to *all* order items that were selected in mass.  NOTE: if no completed date is keyed in, the system will automatically insert as today's date as the completed date, once your edits are saved.

Click **Save** button to successfully mark multiple pending items as deleted.

![](../tests-and-procedures-section-remove-delete-edit.assets/591f353a55d86b8dbe12146606535981.png)

After the system saves your work, the expanded Tests & Procedures section will refresh and the items will be updated and possibly be removed from the pending tests & procedures section if your edit changes encompassed status changes to items.

You have visibility to edited order items (and their respective current status) back in the stand alone Due List Chart Tab typically in the *Past Items* section and where View Details can be utilized to access details of the revision history to an order item that was on the chart's due list.

## Cancel an Added to Exam In-Progress Item

When you have a specific test or procedure item applied to the encounter as in progress (via Add to Exam methods) and have that in progress procedure item expanded/open in your encounter to complete and document the results of that test, you will see an *X* icon which indicates *Hide Section.*

![](../tests-and-procedures-section-remove-delete-edit.assets/02749b41483329932983559747dc5a3c.png)

What this does (if X on the in-progress added to exam item section is clicked): It removes the applied In Progress item section from the encounter and will refresh the encounter outline.  It then places that item back onto the due list (tests & procedures section) back as pending.

The X may be needed because perhaps you had marked an item as *Add to Exam* to be done at today's visit, that indicates the item is in-progress to be performed, resulted & completed), but perhaps changed your mind, or the machine broke down and you realize it cannot perform it today. Using the X (hide section) on the applied in-progress item in the encounter, will remove it from the encounter visit to be performed & completed, and also places the item back up in the Tests & Procedures summary back as *pending status*.

## Due List Portlet

Within the Summary dashboard chart tab, there is a portlet available named** Due List.**  This portlet displays any pending due list items for the chart.  These are not "orders" that were referred out to have performed, but these are pending due list items (tests/procedures) that need to either be ordered and referred out to an outside facility, or items that need performed in office and marked as completed or worked (such as declined, waived, etc). This list is managed in the Due List chart tab and/or from the Tests & Procedures section within encounters.

![](../tests-and-procedures-section-remove-delete-edit.assets/ce14d3297848f044de91a6418f97a73a.png)

Clicking on the pencil icon (manage info icon) from the Due List portlet will take you directly into the Due List chart tab where you can manage due list items and see past items that may have had status changes, edits, or items deleted from a due list.  This portlet on the Summary chart tab simply offers a quick overview of any pending due list items for the chart.  For more information on the Due List portlet and Due List stand alone chart tab, please see [Due List](../health-surveillance/due-list.md) guide.
