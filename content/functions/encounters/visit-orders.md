The Visit Orders encounter section provides the necessary tools for ordering, customizing, delivering, and tracking orders and order requests. Through computerized provider order entry (CPOE), the system streamlines the processes involved in order management. In general, order requests can be created from the encounter via various encounter sections (Visit Orders section being one of them) or from the chart.

### Visit Orders Right Side Quick List Method

A banner or bookmark icon is located on the right side of the Visit Orders encounter section.  This can be clicked to expand open to utilize the right side quick list functionality for the Visit Orders section.

![](../visit-orders.assets/d2cebef3ca386275768818c82b33691d.png)

#### Search field and + of Right Side Quick List Method

A test or procedure item, or even a Health Surveillance Panel can be added to the encounter and due list as a pending order item (or whatever status you determine).  You can simply search for an order item (test/procedure etc) using the search field or click the + icon to search for a specific order item.

![](../visit-orders.assets/cafbb8cafe7b42c3c8a359226b6d23b1.png)

![](../visit-orders.assets/a7cb2e89a0a3456bd4e61154d3f77dff.png)

The search and + (add encounter order) screen essentially acts like adding an order item to the due list.  It simply allows you to get an order item (test/procedure etc) onto the Visit Orders section (and applies it to the due list module also) with specifications you determine (ex: due date, comments, etc).   The search and + is essentially an area to add items to the due list, without having to go back up to the encounter Tests & Procedures section to do it.

![](../visit-orders.assets/094102a69904243a2c3be5c7e115c91e.png)

Then within the Visit Order section (after your selected order items are applied there upon saving), you can do further things to it using the function icons on each row.  Such as create an order requisition of it, or evaluate it if it is a health surveillance panel order item, or add a task regarding it, etc.

![](../visit-orders.assets/9bae73ada4b29b1afc412672b2c56f6c.png)

NOTE: This method inserts the order item(s) as individual order items within the Visit Orders encounter section.  Therefore, those individual orders would be their own individual order requisition(s) when/if made into an order requisition to be referred out.  Using this method does not allow order items to be combined into one order requisition.  If need to make an order requisition for multiple items on one requisition form, please scroll back up to the Tests & Procedures encounter section to generate from there.

#### Protocol Orders

The Visit Orders section can have specific protocol orders available that store specific orderable items in a Protocol Orders picklist (with its own section in the Protocol Orders picklist) named what the protocol is. Once a protocol is selected in Chief Complaint, any matching Protocol Orders will display here in Visit Orders in section expanded view or in right side quicklist view.

![](../visit-orders.assets/ce7cf2679afb5a827ab01ff23c74aff1.png)

The Protocol Order picklist contents of items are configured within the Order-Pick Builder within the Control Panel of the system.

#### Add Referral of Right Side Quick List Method

The *Add Referral* right side quick list method allows you to select a preconfigured Order Picklist category to immediately create an order requisition for specific order tests/procedure items preconfigured within a specific categorized order picklists of that category selected.

![](../visit-orders.assets/2204881cfaceae2ad63d1f6046e05484.png)

![](../visit-orders.assets/151192b79cd8aa4bf8a0e72bf9d64e4e.png)

NOTE: The preconfigured Order Picklist categories that display as an â€˜Add Referral' option selection are managed within the Encounter Types editor (within the control panel) for the specific encounter type configured for your system.  Therefore, various Order Picklists could show or be hidden based on what encounter type you are working in.  For more information on how Encounter Types are configured, please refer to the [Encounter Types](../system-administration/system-controls/encounter-types.md) guide.

Once you select a referral category (ex: Imaging), a pop-up window to Create Requisition will display where you can select specific items to order in one requisition and fill out order details.  Upon save, this will create an order requisition document that can be shared (printed, faxed, etc) and tracked to completion of results being received back. Please visit guide [Order Requests Grid](../order-and-result-management/order-requests-grid.md) for more information on how to manage Order Requisitions.
