The [Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration](https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/medical/driver-medical-requirements/driver-medical-fitness-duty) (FMCSA) requires every driver undergo a physical examination to determine their fitness for duty. A Driver Fitness Determination encounter, often shortened to Driver Fitness or referred to as a DOT encounter, is modeled off of the standards (49 CFR 391.41-391.49) for the Medical Examination Report for Commercial Driver Fitness Determination–FMCSA Form MCSA-5875 and Certificate MCSA-5876–which are used to show and certify a driver's fitness for duty. {{% system-name %}} has designed its Driver Fitness encounter with these standards in mind. With this encounter clinicians are able to easily capture all necessary data, electronically and discretely, making documenting the various components of Form MCSA-5875 and Certificate MCSA-5876 easier than it ever has been.

The Driver Fitness encounter allows electronic data capturing by way of predefined and structured text fields, which are coded for easier data retrieval and accessibility. Data from the encounter can be programmed to overlay forms that are then able to be printed, faxed, submitted, and/or provided as copies. Given its design, the encounter not only streamlines the workflow of determining driver fitness, but it also saves clinicians valuable time through the ability to overlay data on necessary documents, thus reducing the burden of repeatedly documenting the same information for various reporting needs.

## Driver Fitness Determination - Federal

The Department of Transportation (DOT) physical exam is the default for commercial drivers who are examined in accordance with Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (49 CFR 391.41-391.49). Regardless of whether driver fitness determinations need considered according to interstate or intrastate operations, the {{% system-name %}} Driver Fitness Determination encounter can be used to assess and certify drivers, accordingly.

To add and open a Driver Fitness Determination encounter, first navigate to the patient chart and click the **Add Driver Fitness Determination** link, found in the **Quick Links** portlet of the patient's Summary.

{{% tip %}}
Once an encounter is opened, there will be quick navigation links available within the encounter info toolbar, used to quickly access and reopen the current encounter. Clicking the **Driver Fitness** link will open the encounter for additional documenting, and clicking the **View** **Driver Fitness** link will open a view of the encounter, typically used to review previously entered information.

Like any encounter, once it has been created and opened, the encounter navigation toolbar will load with the respective navigation and staging buttons. The navigation buttons are determined by the various categories available within the encounter, used to group the information and collected data. In this case, the Driver Fitness encounter has three categories: 1) **Driver Information**, 2) **Examination Report**, and 3) **Plan**. Each of these can be clicked and used as quick links to the respective section found within each category.

### Driver Information (Section I)

The first part of the encounter is the *Driver Information* section. Within this section, there are fields available for defining the intent of the encounter, as well as for collecting the driver's general demographic and health information. These fields are found within the **Certification Type**, **Personal Information**, and **Driver Health History** sections.

#### Certification Type

To begin, users will need to determine what type of certification is being considered for the visit–New Certification, Recertification, or Follow-up. Depending the type selected, the encounter will load the relevant data available within the patient's chart. To select the certification type, click the section header or the edit (pencil) icon to open the section and choose, accordingly.

![](../driver-fitness-determination-exam-dot.assets/4e4189e7b51c47c6d0f9fa191a2dfac5.png)

* <strong>New Certification</strong> - Pre-populates data within the <em>Personal Information</em> section.
* <strong>Recertification -</strong> Pre-populates data within the <em>Personal Information</em> and <em>Health History</em> sections, based on the previous Driver Fitness encounter.
* <strong>Follow-up</strong> - Pre-populates data within the <em>Personal Information</em>, <em>Health History</em>, <em>Driver Health History Review</em>, <em>Testing</em> (including Vision and Hearing), and <em>Physical Exam</em> sections, based on the previous Driver Fitness encounter.

Once the certification type is selected, click the **Next** button.

#### Personal Information

The Personal Information section is designed to pull in and pre-populate the demographic and driver information relevant to the Driver Fitness encounter. It is important to note that this information cannot be edited from within the encounter and will need updated using the Demographics tab, sometimes found under the Admin chart tab. Other information, such as the Driver License Number and Issuing State for example, will be provided via the Driver Fitness Determination questionnaire.

**Driver ID Verified By** - This field is required by the medical staff/examiner, to verify the type of identification used to verify the driver's identity (e.g., Driver's License, Passport, CDL, etc.)

After providing the type of identification used, click the **Next** button. The Driver Health History section will open.

#### Driver Health History

The Driver Health History section is used to document surgical history, current medications, general demographics, past medical history, and any current conditions/problems. The majority of this information pulls forward from previous exams, as well as any information gathered via questionnaires accessed through the portal (if opted into). In other words, with the portal, users have the ability to fill out a DOT questionnaire electronically, and all the collected information and previous exam data will be pulled into the Driver Fitness encounter, accordingly.

Any previously documented surgeries will be listed under **Surgeries**, and can be edited or added to, as needed. Ensure all information is correct and up-to-date.

![](../driver-fitness-determination-exam-dot.assets/b5c83c1c3281ac7c23448ebec5a94a28.png)

Following Surgeries is **Medications**, where all currently prescribed medications will be listed. These can be edited or added to, as needed. Ensure all information is correct and up-to-date.

![](../driver-fitness-determination-exam-dot.assets/2fbeb9bb40ef441e4dbe1a3f8caad537.png)

Depending on whether or not a portal has been configured for the client, users will be able to either review past medical history and general questions answered by the driver, or enter the responses manually, using the point-and-click functionality within the encounter. Once the information is verified and up-to-date, be sure to review the listed conditions recorded for the driver, shown at the bottom of the questionnaire.

![](../driver-fitness-determination-exam-dot.assets/866fd0a5bd1da438d4bd92b40495f712.png)

Once all of the information has been entered and reviewed, click the **Next** button to continue.

### Examination Report (Section II)

The *Examination Report* section is intended to allow the medical staff/examiner to follow up with and address any of the information provided by the driver, as well as perform an examination of the driver's hearing, vision, and overall body systems. The sections contained are the **Driver Health History Review**, **Testing**, and the **Physical Examination**.

#### Driver Health History Review

The Driver Health History Review allows the medical staff/examiner to review and discuss any pertinent questions answered by the driver when providing their health history.

Once all necessary information has been reviewed and documented, click the **Next** button to proceed to the following section.

#### Testing

Under the Testing section, users can record the driver's pulse, blood pressure, height/weight, as well as urinalysis results and vision/hearing findings.

When recording the findings for visual acuity under the **Vision** section, users will not only have the general questions to answer, they will have the ability to select the preferred method for obtaining and recording visual acuities (i.e., Snellen test or Comprehensive test).

![](../driver-fitness-determination-exam-dot.assets/a8637e2405e1e21865fc63cf97a54023.png)
