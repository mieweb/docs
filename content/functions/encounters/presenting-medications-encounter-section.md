The Presenting Medications encounter section is located in the Visit Encounter Subjective. The left side of the encounter displays a listing of currently known and previously entered medications. The right side of the section contains Quick Links to help the user quickly add medications to the presenting medication list.

Note: Beginning RC202309 an "EXPIRED" alert will display in Red next to any expired medications in the Presenting Medications encounter section. Additionally, users will see "Expired" text in the Past Meds and Current Meds Quick Lists in the Encounter Presenting Medications, Medication Order and Smart Plan encounter sections, as well as the Prescribe Medication and Quick Prescribe in the encounter and/or Medications chart tab. Medications are automatically flagged as expired based on the duration and number of refills that were entered on the original prescription.

## Medication Reconciliation

A new My Settings user preference called "Use Medication Quick Notes" is available for users on RC202409 and newer. The experimental feature is disabled by default, but can be enabled by users wishing to utilize this feature. When enabled, the encounter presenting medications will display in a reconciled list with the subsections as** Unknown, Taking, Not Taking/PRN or Discontinued**. When a new encounter is opened all presenting medications will display under the Unknown subsection. Users are presented with additional buttons to mark each medication as **Taking, Not Taking/PRN, Unknown**, or **Discontinued**.  As each medication is reconciled, the presenting medication will build out to display applicable subsections.
