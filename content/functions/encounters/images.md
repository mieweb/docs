The Images encounter section offers an ability to upload images to become part of the encounter and stored document once the encounter is closed and archived.

For the *Images* encounter section to work appropriately, the system must have a configured document type of ENCPHOTO (Encounter Image).  Supported image types are jpg, jpeg, pdf, and png.

To add an image to the encounter, have your image saved (in one of the supported image types) on your desktop or device and expand open the Images encounter section.

Click *Choose Files* button, search and select the image file(s) you wish, then back in the encounter expanded section, simply click the *Upload Image* button.

The uploaded image(s) then become embedded in the encounter.

When you close and archive the encounter, the image(s) uploaded will become part of the encounter stored document.

### Removing a Linked Image from Encounter

If there is an image within the encounter section, you cannot remove it from the Images encounter section.  The uploaded image(s) store as document type ENCPHOTO (Encounter Image) in the chart.  You can go into the chart and find the stored ENCPHOTO document (typically found in the Documents catch all chart tab), then go to Properties.

From the Properties of the uploaded encounter image, you can either keep the image in the chart and simply Remove Link within the Encounters Linked to Document section or the image document properties **OR** you can delete the Encounter Image document entirely from the chart, which also in turn removes the link to the encounter.
