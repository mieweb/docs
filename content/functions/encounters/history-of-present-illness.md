Within an encounter, there is an HPI (History of Present Illness) section that can be utilized.

The encounter HPI can be added or edited.

To add or edit HPI information in the encounter, simply click anywhere on the HPI grey title section area to expand open that section.

Use the free text fields, speech to text dictation icon, or use the macros on the far right to quickly get the HPI documented.

NOTE: HPI fields (when in expanded mode) reflect any chief complaint protocol(s) selected.  Otherwise, if no chief complaint protocol is designated on the encounter, the HPI section will default to offering our standard work related HPI questions.  For more information on chief complaint protocols, please see separate guide [Encounter Protocols](encounter-protocols.md).

### Copy from Previous Exam

Within the HPI encounter section, there is an icon that offers *Copy from Previous Exam* functionality.

The *Copy from Previous Exam* icon pops up a window to allow you to select HPI data that you wish to copy from the chart's prior encounter(s) to this current encounter.
