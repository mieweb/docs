The *Physical Exam* encounter section is an optional section that can be applied to the encounter outline.  This can be used to help document a physical exam regarding the visit within an encounter.

NOTE: If performing a Visual Exam (for example in a Telehealth/virtual event), you can toggle this physical exam encounter section to be a Visual Exam section instead.  See more information in the [Visual Exam](visual-exam.md) guide.

### Add a Physical Exam - Flowsheet

The Physical Exam encounter section points to a specific flowsheet configured in the system.  This flowsheet can be customized for your needs.  A configured flowsheet named *Physical Exam* in the flowsheet editor will display the data capture fields in the encounter Physical Exam section. Using the Physical Exam flowsheet allows your system to capture unique or custom information for your practice to document in an encounter within the Physical Exam encounter section.

To utilize a flowsheet method in Physical Exam, a flowsheet named *Physical Exam* must exist with contents.

NOTE: Physical Exam fields (when in expanded mode) reflect any chief complaint protocol(s) selected.  Otherwise, if no chief complaint protocol is designated on the encounter, the Physical Exam section will default to offering our standard work related Physical Exam flowsheet questions.  For more information on chief complaint protocols, please see separate guide [Encounter Protocols](encounter-protocols.md).

## Copy from Previous Exam

Within the Physical Exam encounter section, there is an icon that offers *Copy from Previous Exam* functionality.

The *Copy from Previous Exam* icon pops up a window to allow you to select Physical Exam field data that you wish to copy from the chart's prior encounter(s) to this current encounter.

For more detailed information, please refer to guide [Copy from Previous Exam](copy-from-previous-exam.md#copy-existing-visits).
## Macros

If utilizing a Physical Exam flowsheet, library macros offered in the physical exam encounter section are a way to quickly insert predefined text with minimal user input depending on what library your encounter is set to or the physical exam section library that is set to.

For additional information on configuring and utilizing macros that can be utilized within the physical exam encounter section, please see separate guide [Macros](../system-configuration/macros.md#properties-of-a-macro) and/or [Libraries](libraries.md).

## Encounter Stored Document

The physical exam encounter section does become part of the encounter visit note document once closed and archived.
