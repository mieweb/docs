While working in a chart or any chart tab, if the chart has a ‘current' and open encounter for your login, you will see easy accessible buttons to jump right into that ‘current' and open encounter for your workflow needs to document within that ‘current' and open encounter.  This is essentially the Current Encounter Summary bar.  It gives buttons to quickly be able to jump into the data entry side of that encounter, or into the view side of that encounter as well as date of service.

The current open encounter bar will also expand to display other summary information of the encounter such as protocol being used, visit type, work related case information, date of injury  (if applicable), etc.

A current open encounter, for your user experience when working in a specific chart, is identified as open encounters that you have specifically been in to do some work (or have created/generated that encounter) and have marked as **current**.   You can only have one encounter set as ‘current' per chart.  However, a chart may have several various ‘open' encounters for workflow needs.

Visibility to which encounter is current for you on the chart is visible from the Open Encounters portlet of the Summary dashboard and is signified with the bold word of **Current**.

The encounter that is **current** for your session in a specific chart is as well visible from the separate Encounters chart tab listing.

NOTE: Closed encounters can also be marked as ‘current', but the encounter buttons in the current encounter summary bar will not be available and signifies the encounter is ***CLOSED***.

A chart could have several encounters open. But, in order to enter data into an encounter it must be current and open.
