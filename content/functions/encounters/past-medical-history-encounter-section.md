## No Past Medical History

For clients on 202403 and newer, the Past Medical History Encounter Quick List includes an option for "No Past Medical History". The "No Past Medical History" option will ONLY display in the Quick List if no other PMH conditions are already listed on the chart.

![](../past-medical-history-encounter-section.assets/af5b88667b1fe32a8fbd4d88cf8dd005.png)

If "No Past Medical History" is the only item on the patient's PMH condition list, and the user attempts to add a new condition to the PMH, the system will prompt the user asking if they would like to remove "No Past Medical History" from the chart.

![](../past-medical-history-encounter-section.assets/f3a944a9ca302adb237be9710b77f0d9.png)

This functionality will also carry over to the *Conditions* chart tab for clients who use the Conditions chart tab to manage the Past Medical History.
