If "No Past Medical History" is the only item on the patient's PMH condition list, and the user attempts to add a new condition to the PMH, the system will prompt the user asking if they would like to remove "No Past Medical History" from the chart.

![](../past-medical-history-encounter-section.assets/f3a944a9ca302adb237be9710b77f0d9.png)

This functionality will also carry over to the *Conditions* chart tab for clients who use the Conditions chart tab to manage the Past Medical History.
