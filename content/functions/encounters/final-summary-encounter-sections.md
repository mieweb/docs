Working in an encounter, there is a Summary section that offers 4 optional sections.  The Summary encounter section offers Final Medications, Final Allergies, Final Medical History, and Final Restrictions & Accommodations.  These individual sections are optional for use on the encounter and its encounter view and stored/archived document once an encounter is closed & archived.

The optional ‘Final' sections display a quick final list/summary that were keyed in. It's another way to quickly see some sections of this current encounter data as a summary list, but is not editable in this Summary section.  These are optional encounter sections that can be utilized when working in encounters.

Example: Final Allergies is an optional encounter section that can be utilized when working in encounters.

You can toggle to *Detail View* using the icon in the Final Allergies section.

Detail View displays more specific detailed information of Final Allergies from the encounter.

If the Final Allergies section was set to display and be visible on the encounter entry side, that section will be applied to the encounter ‘view' and also will become part of the stored document once the encounter is closed & archived.
