When using the Search field prior to clicking the "+" button, the user will see a partial list of options in the *Add Allergy/Intolerance* screen.

It is recommended that users select from predefined options from the dropdown allergy name field. Items in the dropdown are stored as coded/structured data within the system. The system will allow users to enter free text, however when done so, this data is not structured and limits reporting capabilities.

### Add Allergy/Intolerance

Once the allergy **_Name_** has been entered, indicate by radio button if it is an Allergy or an Intolerance.

Begin typing the type of reaction encountered by this allergy. The **_Reaction_**** field will accept free text, however, selecting from the autocomplete is recommended.  To the right of the **_Reaction_** field is a drop down for **_Severity_**. Severity options include, Mild, Moderate or Severe. Comments may be added in the **_Comments_** field, as well as a **_Start Date_** and **_End Date_**, if applicable.

If the allergy entered is common and you would like to add it as a default choice to the current encounter Library, click the **_Save to Library_** button. This will only add the allergy to the library and it will not add it to the encounter.

Click the **_Save_** button to add the allergy to the patient allergy list. Click the **_Add Another_** to save the allergy to the patient allergy list and refresh the screen to immediately proceed and add another.
