### Phase 1 ICD11 Integration within our system

For Phase 1 within {{% system-name %}} , ICD11 will integrate the following into the system:

* ICD-11 offers an integrated online Browse and Coding Tool for routine use. For cases that require additional detail, ICD-11 supports post-coordination (combining stem and extension codes, or stem and stem codes) through tool-assisted workflows.
* The ICD11 Tool button opens an ICD11 Post-Coordination Tool screen to search for a condition which then results in an output of various matching condition names with ICD11 codes for selection.
    * The ICD11 Post-Coordination Tool screen also allows other functionality.
