When working in any encounter, there is a *Warnings and Guidelines* encounter section available.  By default, this lists all presenting warnings and guidelines for the specific chart in a summary format. The presenting warnings & guidelines alerts are current for the chart as of today's logged in date, that have not been dismissed.  This section is for visibility purposes to quickly see any warnings or guideline alerts a chart has when working in an encounter exam.

Warnings or Guideline alerts cannot be dismissed from the Warnings and Guidelines encounter section.  You must go to the encounter ‘view', or the Warnings & Alerts portlet within the summary dashboard of the chart, or the stand alone Warnings chart tab to dismiss warnings or guideline alerts on a chart. Refer to guide [Alerts Tab - Warnings](../e-chart/alerts-tab-warnings.md) to learn more about these areas to dismiss any warnings or guideline alerts needed.
