# Smart Plan Quick Lists

The Smart Plan is an optional section that is displayed at the top of the Visit Encounter. The Smart Plan is similar to the Assessment, however, it is located at the top of the encounter and it is intended to be a combination of both the Assessment and Plan sections. This section is ideal for providers who prefer to drive the encounter based on patient conditions.

Providers will use the Smart Plan Quick List (right side of the blue vertical bar) to populate the Smart Plan Assessment with conditions and orders for today's visit (left side of the blue vertical bar). Providers can leverage a combination of features, such as pre-configured libraries, pre-populated data based on existing data in the patient chart and/or database, organize conditions, as well as quickly order and perform tests, add procedures, and manage medications from the Smart Plan.

# Managing Smart Plan Order Items

* Once orders have been selected for exam driven conditions in the Smart Plan, orders display under the orange "Future" heading.
* Future orders are "Pending" orders on the Due List.
* To the right of each order on the Smart Plan, the user has six (6) options.

![](../smart-plan.assets/28d8c41413c0c751d49871b7fe28010c.png)

1. ## Requisition
* Selecting this option on an order will call the order Requisition screen. An order requisition is typically created for orders that will be performed outside of the system. From here users can create an order to be electronically sent via an interface or printed/faxed from the system.
* The order item selected will populate the order items list within the Requisition screen. All other orders on the Due list (including any orders selected as part of today's Smart Plan) will populate the Due List Quick List and can quickly be added to the Requisition so that all items are on one order request.

![](../smart-plan.assets/86d282666dff62ff3294ef9062375411.png)

* Once a Requisition has been created, the items will display under a purple "Requisitions" header in the Smart Plan. Requisition orders can be edited, printed or labels printed from the Smart Plan.

2. ## Add to Exam

* "The Lightning Bolt/Add to Exam" option will add this test to the Tests & Procedures section of the encounter.
* The order item will still display under the condition, but it will display under a green "Today" heading to indicate that it is to be performed today. The order item will indicate "Not complete" in red to the side of the order until the test has been resulted/entered AND the order marked as complete. This is done as a safety precaution to ensure that testing has been completed and for clients utilizing a billing interface to ensure charges are electronically sent to the billing system.

* Clicking on the test name in the Smart Plan will immediately cause the encounter to scroll to the Test & Procedures section, where the test where the test ordered can be resulted/entered and marked as completed.

3. ## Edit

* Selecting this option will generate the Edit Encounter Order screen.
* Users can update the order status, due date, complete date, visible date, add order comments or change the condition for which this order item was created.
* In some instances, users may need to task someone else in the clinic if an order is edited. If needed, users can add a task from the Edit Encounter Order screen as well.

4. ## Delete

* Selecting this option will prompt the Remove Encounter Order screen
* Users will be asked to confirm they wish to remove the order before the action is completed.
* Users will also be able to view revision history including notes, revisions, tasks and links.

5. ## Add Task

* Selecting this option will call the Add Task screen.
* Since a task is generated from the Order item and is not a document, the Regarding field in the task will read "doc ID is zero".

![](../smart-plan.assets/9c3cced858c2f3a5e48947e034d98acb.png)

* A task will be generated and appear on the task list for the appropriate user or department. See our online help for more information on [Tasking](https://docs.enterprisehealth.com/functions/task-management/task-list/).

![](../smart-plan.assets/087bbad40927988c737a37d809ceac6b.png)

![](../smart-plan.assets/8c01f50f5e34eb17ae1e017ad21a2689.png)
