* Chrome and Firefox for iOS will not work. iOS users will need to use Safari.  
** WebRTC support in Safari started with Safari version 11  
*** We recommend migrating to the new Chromium Edge as soon as possible as we will stop supporting ORTC in the near future


## FAQ

**What hardware is required?**
* iPhone (iOS 11+), Android (KitKat+), Windows 10 with Edge or Chrome or Firefox, MacBook (OS X El Capitan).
**Why not use FaceTime, Google Duo, or Skype?**
* Unfortunately, there isn't a single tool for video visits. FaceTime only works with iPhones and Google Duo or Skype requires the patient to install the app. 
* After the use of an App, the patient can call the provider directly. <strong>There is no way to block caller ID so the provider could get calls directly from patients at all hours.</strong> WebChart TeleHealth allows the provider to control when sessions can be done and allows the staff to participate easily and triage/transfer sessions. 
**What is the 1135 Waiver?**
* Under this new waiver, Medicare will pay for office, hospital, and other visits furnished via telehealth across the country, including in patient's places of residence starting March 6, 2020.  A range of providers, such as doctors, nurse practitioners, clinical psychologists, and licensed clinical social workers, will be able to offer telehealth to their patients.  Additionally, the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) is providing flexibility for healthcare providers to reduce or waive cost-sharing for telehealth visits paid by federal healthcare programs. The [CMS fact sheet](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/medicare-telemedicine-health-care-provider-fact-sheet) outlines the waiver.
