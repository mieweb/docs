The Visual Exam encounter section is found within the Objective area of an encounter.  The Physical Exam encounter section can be toggled to be a Visual Exam encounter section (and vice versa).

The Visual Exam encounter section is typically used when documenting a telehealth or virtual online type visit and not physically present with the patient.  To document a Visual Exam, simply go to the Physical Exam encounter section and click the Visual Exam toggle button at the far right.

## Visual Exam - Flowsheet

The Visual Exam encounter section points to a specific flowsheet configured in the system.  This flowsheet can be customized for your needs.  A configured flowsheet named *Visual Exam* in the flowsheet editor will display the data capture fields in the encounter Visual Exam section. Using the Visual Exam flowsheet allows your system to capture unique or custom information for your practice to document in an encounter within the Visual Exam encounter section.

To utilize a flowsheet method in Visual Exam, a flowsheet named *Visual Exam* must exist with contents.

For additional information on configuring and utilizing Chief Complaint protocols that can be utilized within the Visual Exam encounter section, please see separate guide [Encounter Protocols](encounter-protocols.md).

## Macros

If utilizing a visual Exam flowsheet, library macros offered in the Visual Exam encounter section are a way to quickly insert predefined text with minimal user input depending on what library your encounter is set to or the Visual Exam section library that is set to.
