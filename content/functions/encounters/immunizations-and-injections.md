When using the Search field prior to clicking the "+" button, the user will see a partial list of options in the *Add Injection* screen.

Once the *Add Injection* screen displays, select an option from the injection name dropdown list or begin typing the injection name.

It is recommended that users select from predefined options from the dropdown injection/immunization name field. Items in the dropdown are stored as coded/structured data within the system. The system will allow users to enter free text as a historical injection record, however when done so, this data is not structured and limits reporting capabilities.

### Add Injection

Once the injection **_Name_** has been entered and selected, type the date the historical injection was given.

Begin typing the type of reaction encountered by this injection The **_Reaction_**** field will accept free text.

Click the **_Save_** button to add the historical injection record to the patient's immunization/injection list. Click the **_Add Another_** to save the historical injection record to the patient's list and it will refresh the screen to immediately proceed and add another.
