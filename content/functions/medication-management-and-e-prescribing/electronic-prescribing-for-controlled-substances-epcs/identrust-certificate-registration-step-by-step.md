Physicians who wish to electronically prescribe controlled medications must employ two-factor authentication as required by the DEA. Medical Informatics Engineering (MIE) works with IdenTrust to provide the required level of identity proofing needed for Electronic Prescribing for Controlled Substances (EPCS). IdenTrust will issue digital certificate tokens that can be used to digitally sign and electronically transmit prescriptions for controlled substances. By providing required information to IdenTrust, physicians can complete identity proofing and establish two-factor authentication for two years. Physicians will receive a USB device that will generate a digital signature.

To obtain a USB Token, physicians must register with IdenTrust, and verify their identity. Only the subscriber of the certificate shall use the token. The digital certificate is solely that of the registering prescriber and should be treated as a form of identification, similar to a passport or driver's license.

THE APPLICATION AND IDENTITY VERIFICATION PROCESS MUST BE COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED BY THE REGISTRANT AND SUBSCRIBER OF THE CERTIFICATE. THIS CANNOT BE COMPLETED BY PROXY, OR BY ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL ON BEHALF OF THE PRESCRIBER. FAILURE TO COMPLY COULD RESULT IN REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION OF THE DIGITAL CERTIFICATE.

This step-by-step help guide will walk you through the online application process. Before you begin, have the following ready:
* Credit Card information for address verification only (not used for payment)
* Credit Card information for payment
* Valid Email Address

Here at IdenTrust, we are often contacted by people who have forgotten their passwords. We will always try to help. Unfortunately, in many cases, there is nothing we can do, and you, the customer, will have to start over and apply for a new certificate.  
There are two passwords you will NEED TO REMEMBER:  
**Account Password**  
Next, you will create your Account Password with Secret Questions and Answers. This password will be used to download your certificate after your application is approved. If this Account Password is forgotten, you may reset it using your Secret Questions and Answers.  
**If you are unable to recall the Answers to your Secret Questions, you will have to start over and apply again.**  
**Token Passcode**  
A passcode is required for the hardware that will store your certificate.You will create the Passcode when you download your certificate. The Token Passcode must be entered when you use your certificate.  
**If the Token Passcode is forgotten, your certificate is locked and cannot be recovered, so you would need to purchase a new IGC Basic Assurance Unaffiliated Hardware + 2-Year Certificate.**
