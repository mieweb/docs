Can also click (view) in the date flow column of a specific medication to view the full prescription details and edit from there.

## Pat. Ed Link

You can print out this page and hand it to the patient. It lists everything in their Medication History screen.

When it opens, it is set to automatically go to the print mode. Make sure you have selected the correct printer and click Print.

It lists *Current Medications* with the drug name, instructions, and reason for taking or to stop taking.

This Patient Education Sheet lists *Medication Changes* with sub-categories of *Medications to Start Taking*, *Medication Changes*, and *Medications to Stop Taking*. The Patient Education document also lists the pharmacy in which the respected medication was sent to.

This does **not** show discontinued medications that expired (reading from the date entered in Discontinued Date on a prescription). It does show discontinued medications that you discontinued for a specific reason in the *Medications to Stop Taking*.

Scripts written to begin on future dates appear under *Current Medications*.

To get out of the Patient Education screen, click the red X at the top right of the screen to close out the window.

## Med Sheet Link

This is an optional program. Your practice has to request that this program be turned on for your system.

When it opens, it is set to automatically go to the print mode. Make sure you have selected the correct printer and click Print. You can print out this page to send to another practice, use to fax, or use internally in your practice.

It lists everything in the patient's Medication History screen. It lists *Allergies / Intolerances, Current Medications, Changed Meds, Updates, and Medication History*. This does not show deleted meds.
