MedicalCodify.com takes the official sets of a wide variety of medical codes and adds millions of cross references between codes to make finding specific codes and discovering new codes easy.

MedicalCodify.com is our "global" search tool for medical coding system data as a "data dictionary" of medical codes accessible to search and get detailed information from within {{% system-name %}}.  The MedicalCodify.com search tool allows you to search in one place for a number of different code sets across multiple medical needs (drugs, allergies, conditions, procedures, lab results, etc). MedicalCodify also shows all official relationships between different code sets.  To begin, simply search for a term or code in the search bar at the top of the MedicalCodify.com page.

**M****edicalCodify** is the name of our project that makes medications, order codes, and multiple medical code information easy to search in one place.  Put simply, it is an encyclopedia of medical codes that ties together concepts across different code systems.  Medical Codify has bidirectional navigation between drugs and conditions: when viewing a condition page (SNOMED or ICD10 codes).  A user can see which medications have that condition as a contraindication, indication, or side effect, and when viewing drug information, ingredients, therapeutic classes, and duplicate therapy groups are now clickable to explore related medications. Additionally, you can now search for drug classes, duplicate therapy groups, and specific ingredients directly in Medical Codify's advanced search options.

Currently, MedicalCodify has search capabilities for:

* ICD-10/ICD-9
* ICD10-PCS
* SNOMED
* LOINC
* HCPCS (Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System)
* LabCorp Order Codes
* Quest Order Codes
* RxNORM
* NDC
* CVX
* Value Sets
* Measures
* FDB (First Databank) Medications
* FDB (First Databank) Drug Names
* MedicalCodify.com simple search is by term or code.  It then results in any matching selections and once a selection is clicked, it will advance you to its detailed information.
    * Advanced Search allows one or more various data sets to be searched.  It then results in any matching selections and once a selection is clicked, it will advance you to its detailed information.
