# Artificial Intelligence (AI) Overview

## Key Features and Endpoints

**POST /v1/completions:** Generates text completions.

**POST /v1/chat:** Facilitates chat-based interactions.

**POST /v1/assistant:** Powers chat-assistant functionalities.

**POST /v1/embeddings:** Generates embeddings from input text.

**POST /v1/transcription:** Transcribes voice input into text.

**Data Privacy and Retention**

We have signed a zero-retention agreement with OpenAI. Our system operates open models on our own hardware, ensuring minimal data retention within our gateways. LLaVA is available for image inference, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can be configured to enhance performance by pre-processing chart data the night before a patient visit.

**Output Capabilities**

Wellby supports text and audio output, functioning as a minimal reasoning engine integrated with MIE's BlueHive Enterprise Health and WebChart EHR product lines.

**Modes of Operation**

**Ambient AI:** Facilitates transcription, chat, and image capture to generate visit summaries, transcribe orders, letters, prescriptions, and patient education materials.

**Language Support:** The AI understands 98 languages and is fluent in 55 languages.

**BlueHive AI**

**Patient Visit Contextualization**

BlueHive AI offers zero-context reasoning during patient visits. It captures interviews and images, leveraging these to generate notes, send messages, perform integrations, trigger functions, and share content with other providers, employers, and patients. It can also complete government forms automatically.
