[**Printing & Print Definitions**](gdoc:1NHBPyY_YvI92JSil-rc3O0Kpu5qYLkdKWZTNjlzQpNY):
Users can not only print individual documents, but they can also print groups of documents, or definitions. Print definitions provide ways to group many documents, forms, layouts, or the like into a defined print or fax job. These jobs can also be sent as a secure email, or even created as a batch, so that the print definition(s) can be printed or faxed, at a later time.
