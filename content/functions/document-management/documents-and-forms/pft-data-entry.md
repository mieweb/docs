Navigating to the **Medical Record/PFT** chart tab. The chart tab will display an entry screen to key in a new PFT test, but will also show a *List View* of all of the archived/closed (i.e., stored documents) PFT tests at the bottom of the page.

2. If performing a <em>New Manual Test</em>, begin filling in the fields with the appropriate data.
3. In the PFT manual-entry screen, there is the ability to enter an interpretation and mark a maneuver as the <em>best maneuver</em>. In the list of all maneuvers, views of the interpretation of a maneuver will show the first 25 characters, with the rest visible while hovering.

The data will be stored in the system in the **PFT** chart tab.

### Add from Encounter Section

The PFT may be added to an encounter in multiple ways. One method is by selecting the PFT order on the **Due List**, found in the *Tests & Procedures* section of the encounter, then using the **Perform** button to allow for manual entry or device import.

If the PFT is not found on the Due List, it can be autocompleted in the Tests & Procedures section and added to the encounter.

Alternatively, the PFT may be selected using the **Picklist** icon by selecting the order from the list and adding it to the encounter.

### Import PFT Data From Device

When accessing the PFT chart tab after adding a new PFT, there is the ability to enter data manually, or upload results from a device if an interface is established. To utilize the semi-automatic process of uploading results from the device interface, simply click the **Load From Device** import button, select the appropriate file, and click **Upload File** (see other help documentation named [Device Interface â€“ PFT System](../../system-administration/interfaces/device-interface-pft-system.md), for more information).

## Reporting

These types of report links are generally found in the **Reports** sidemenu, under the [Visits](https://system/?f=layout&module=reports&name=Visits&tabmodule=reports&t=Visits&tabmodule=reports&tabselect=Visits) grouping of reports. These reports enable a client to review the various data captured during a visit or encounter. The PFT Summary Report is available here, for example.
