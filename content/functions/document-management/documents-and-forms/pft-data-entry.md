## Manual Entry

### Add From Chart Tab

Navigating to the **Medical Record/PFT** chart tab. The chart tab will display an entry screen to key in a new PFT test, but will also show a *List View* of all of the archived/closed (i.e., stored documents) PFT tests at the bottom of the page.

2. If performing a <em>New Manual Test</em>, begin filling in the fields with the appropriate data.
3. In the PFT manual-entry screen, there is the ability to enter an interpretation and mark a maneuver as the <em>best maneuver</em>. In the list of all maneuvers, views of the interpretation of a maneuver will show the first 25 characters, with the rest visible while hovering.

PFT Interpretation data can be populated as an encounter view. This is an optional setting that can be enabled on encounter views to show PFT Interpretation.

The data will be stored in the system in the **PFT** chart tab.

### Add from Encounter Section

The PFT may be added to an encounter in multiple ways. One method is by selecting the PFT order on the **Due List**, found in the *Tests & Procedures* section of the encounter, then using the **Perform** button to allow for manual entry or device import.

If the PFT is not found on the Due List, it can be autocompleted in the Tests & Procedures section and added to the encounter.

Alternatively, the PFT may be selected using the **Picklist** icon by selecting the order from the list and adding it to the encounter.

### Import PFT Data From Device

Users on RC202503 will no longer have the option to **Load from Device**. As of RC202503, users must update import controls to use the *MIE Device App*. Users will save PFT results to the *MIE Device App* and the device app will automatically import results to the patient chart and insert results as a separate document. The PFT procedure encounter section is still available for users to manually enter PFT results.

For databases on RC202409 and older, users will still have the ability to enter data manually, or upload results from a device using the Load From Device controls provided a PFT interface has been established. To utilize uploading results from a device, see other help documentation named [Device Interface â€“ PFT System](../../system-administration/interfaces/device-interface-pft-system.md), for more information.

## Reporting

These types of report links are generally found in the **Reports** sidemenu, under the [Visits](https://system/?f=layout&module=reports&name=Visits&tabmodule=reports&t=Visits&tabmodule=reports&tabselect=Visits) grouping of reports. These reports enable a client to review the various data captured during a visit or encounter. The PFT Summary Report is available here, for example.
