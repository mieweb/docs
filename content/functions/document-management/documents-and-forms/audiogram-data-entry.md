Data entry can be addressed a few different ways in {{% system-name %}} . Bubble forms are a very convenient and efficient solution. Bubble forms are document type templates with special formatting that allow data to be collected when documents of that type are scanned and indexed into the {{% system-name %}} system. This data is stored discretely, as observations, within {{% system-name %}}.

Bubble forms also work well added to Print Definitions, particularly for providers that do not use interfaced equipment. Bubble forms can also be developed so that a stack of the forms can be printed and taken onsite, where they then can be scanned and indexed, afterward.
  
## Bubble Form  
  
There is a standard audiogram bubble form that is available in the {{% system-name %}} system. This bubble form collects audiogram data, and once scanned and indexed into the system, the optical marks are read and the interpreted data is stored discretely, within the appropriate chart.

To access and utilize a bubble form to record information, simply navigate to the Forms Library and print the preferred form. After the form has been completed, scan the form into the system and index it, accordingly. If any of the indexed information needs edited immediately after scanning, simply use the confirmation window to verify all values were read correctly, prior to validating. Once the scan and values are confirmed, the data will index into the chart in context, as appropriate. To better understand the scanning and indexing of bubble forms, review the [Indexing Bubble Forms](../scanning-and-indexing/indexing-bubble-forms.md) and [Indexing](../scanning-and-indexing/indexing.md) documentation.
1. While in the appropriate chart, access and print the vision bubble form by clicking the <strong>Add Document</strong> link. This will open the Document/Forms Library, where all forms can be accessed.
2. Find and open the necessary form by visually locating it in the list and clicking the <strong>Form</strong> link. Otherwise, begin typing in the <strong>Doc Type Search</strong> autocomplete, select the appropriate form, and click <strong>Submit</strong> to open the document.

3. Print out the bubble form.
4. Record the results by coloring in the respective bubbles, then scan and index the form(s) back into the appropriate chart(s).

Bubble forms can also be generated as generic, unassociated with a specific chart, to allow for mass use. Print a stack of generic forms to take onsite, and afterward, scan and index them into the appropriate charts.

## Manual Entry  

There are alternative, manual processes outside of using and scanning in bubble forms. These options include using an interfaced device and importing data into the system, which can be edited and/or updated, manually; or by using the appropriate encounter or adding and inputting the results as test/procedure results within or outside of an encounter. Both of these methods are also highly effective.
  
### Add From Chart Tab  

Navigating to the **Test Results** chart tab allows users to select what type of results need to be entered or reviewed. One of the types of results is **Audiogram** results. When selected, the screen will display a **List View** of all of the existing audiogram data from encounters that are archived/closed (i.e., stored documents) within the system.
  
![](../audiogram-data-entry.assets/10000201000005080000015F639BB942FDA8BF00.png)  

1. Click the <strong>Add Audiogram</strong> link, in the upper-right corner.

{{% note %}}  
In RC201812 and newer, the Add Audiogram link has been removed in favor of using the Order Quick Links patient portlet.  
{{% /note %}}

2. This will create an Audiogram encounter in the chart and make available the Audiogram data fields. To begin manually entering data into the fields, click the <strong>New</strong> button. The Left Ear/Right Ear grid entry fields are protected until users click the <em>New</em> button, below the grid.

3. Key in the audiogram data for both ears in the Active row. For more information on the other audiogram data fields, please refer to the [Audio Tool Tab](../../system-administration/interfaces/audio-tool-tab.md) documentation.
4. Test Date is a required field for audiograms. The audiogram data will not save until there is a test date/time noted.

5. When finished, click the <strong>Save</strong> button.

The data will be stored in the **Test Results** chart tab. If the recorded data is preferred elsewhere in the system, do not hesitate to reach out to Helpdesk. They are happy to work with clients to develop ways to address any specific business needs.
  
### Add from Encounter Section  

Another alternative to the bubble form is using a manual process of entering results is through the **Tests & Procedures** section of a visit encounter.
The audiogram may be added to a visit encounter in multiple ways. One method is by selecting the audiogram order on the **Due List**, found within the *Tests & Procedures* section of the encounter, and using the **Add to Exam** button, to allow for manual entry or device import.
  
![](../audiogram-data-entry.assets/100002010000058D000001B92EBC1A9B2950D410.png)  

There is also an **Answer Questions** button available, which allows clinicians to ask and record answers to audiometric questions at the time of the visit; or if a Check-in Kiosk is used, the questions may be answered by the patient, upon check-in.
  
![](../audiogram-data-entry.assets/1000020100000597000001823E222F21FD7482F8.png)  

If the audiogram is not found on the Due List, the order can be autocompleted in the Tests & Procedures section and added to the visit encounter using the **Add to Exam** button.
  
![](../audiogram-data-entry.assets/10000201000001BA000000E0930F670701EE15F4.png)  

Alternatively, the audiogram may be selected using the **Picklist** icon by selecting the order from the list and adding it to the visit encounter.
  
![](../audiogram-data-entry.assets/10000201000004AA0000022EECB65DE11AF176DC.png)  

For additional information on how to proceed keying in audiogram data, refer to the [Audio Tool Tab](../../system-administration/interfaces/audio-tool-tab.md) documentation.
  
### Import Audio Data From Device  

From the Test Results Audiogram encounter, or from the applied Audiogram section of the visit encounter, users have the ability to import audiogram results from a device, instead of the manually entering all of the data. To utilize the semi-automatic process of uploading results from the device interface, simply scroll down to below the data entry fields of the Audiogram encounter, or section. If a device interface has been established, there will be the option to choose the interface and select the appropriate file for upload. Select the appropriate file, and click **Upload File**.

{{% info %}}

The interfacing options are also available from the visit encounter, so that audiogram data can be imported from a device, directly into the visit encounter.
{{% /info %}}
Users may perform an audiogram in real time, via an established device interface. For more information on device interfaces and file uploads, see the help documentation [Device Interface – Audio System](../../system-administration/interfaces/device-interface-audio-system.md) and [Device Interface – Audio-Tremetrics-Maico](../../system-administration/interfaces/device-interface-audio-tremetrics-maico.md).

## Reporting  

These types of report links are generally found in the **Reports** sidemenu tab, under the [Visits](https://system/?f=layout&module=reports&name=Visits&tabmodule=reports&t=Visits&tabmodule=reports&tabselect=Visits) grouping of reports. These reports enable a client to review the various data captured during a visit or encounter. The Audiogram Report is available here, for example.
