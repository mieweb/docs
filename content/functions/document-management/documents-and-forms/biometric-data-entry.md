Data entry can be addressed a few different ways in {{% system-name %}} . Bubble forms are a very convenient and efficient solution. Bubble forms are document type templates with special formatting that allow data to be collected when documents of that type are scanned and indexed into the {{% system-name %}} system. This data is stored discretely, as observations, within {{% system-name %}}.

Bubble forms also work well added to Print Definitions, particularly for providers that do not use interfaced equipment. Bubble forms can also be developed so that a stack of the forms can be printed and taken onsite, where they then can be scanned and indexed, afterward.
  
## Bubble Form  
  
There is a standard biometric bubble form that is available in the {{% system-name %}} system. This bubble form collects biometric data (e.g., blood pressure, pulse, temp, height, weight, waist circumference, hip circumference). Once scanned and indexed into the system, the optical marks are read and the interpreted data is stored discretely, in the appropriate chart.

To access and utilize a bubble form for recording information, simply navigate to the Forms Library and print the preferred form. After the form has been completed, scan the form into the system and index it, accordingly. If any of the indexed information needs edited immediately after scanning, simply use the confirmation window to verify all values were read correctly, prior to validating. Once the scan and values are confirmed, the data will index into the chart in context, as appropriate. To better understand the scanning and indexing of bubble forms, review the [Indexing Bubble Forms](gdoc:16p4qLN-NFRG4ZZ61_cRrU3X5iw7fmZ-B1JMZYh_Vo8c) and [Indexing](gdoc:1Q3zud5gpDVgfHepoHWOthPPN-iWWMV_H_0-jFxxssV8) documentation.
1. While in the appropriate chart, access and print the bubble form by clicking the <strong>Add Document</strong> link. This will open the Document/Forms Library, where all forms can be accessed.
2. Find and open the necessary form by visually locating it in the list and clicking the <strong>Form</strong> link. Otherwise, begin typing in the <strong>Doc Type Search</strong> autocomplete, select the appropriate form, and click <strong>Submit</strong> to open the document.

3. Print out the bubble form.
4. Record the result by coloring in the respective bubbles, then scan and index the form(s) back into the appropriate chart(s).

{{% info %}}
Bubble forms can also be generated as generic, unassociated with a specific chart, to allow for mass use. Print a stack of generic forms to take onsite, and afterward, scan and index them into the appropriate charts.

## Manual Entry  

There are alternative, manual processes outside of using and scanning in bubble forms. These options include using an interfaced device and importing data into the system, which can be edited and/or updated, manually; or by using the appropriate encounter or adding and inputting the results as test/procedure results within or outside of an encounter. Both of these methods are also highly effective.
  
### Add from Chart Tab  

Navigating to the **Medical Record** **Vital Signs** chart tab allows users to select what type of results need to be entered or reviewed. In the Vital Signs chart tab, the screen will display a *List View* of all of the existing biometric data.

1. Key in the biometric/vitals data in the fields provided. Set the observed date/time field.
2. When finished, click the <strong>Submit</strong> button

The data will be stored in the system, under the **Vital Signs** chart tab, as well as anywhere vitals are displayed. If the recorded data is preferred elsewhere in the system, do not hesitate to reach out to Helpdesk. We are happy to work with clients to develop ways to address any specific business needs.
  
### Add from Vitals Encounter Section  

Another alternative to the bubble form is entering results manually, through the Vitals section of a visit encounter. When in a visit encounter, click the Vitals banner (or pencil icon) to expand the section for editing. The biometric data fields will display for data entry.

### Biometric Encounter  

There is a Biometric encounter available, but the bubble form isn't meant to coincide with the encounter of the same name. Contact the Deployment Consultant if information is needed for using Biometric encounters.

## Reporting  

Biometric reports are generally found in the **Reports** sidemenu, under the [Visits](https://system/?f=layout&module=reports&name=Visits&tabmodule=reports&t=Visits&tabmodule=reports&tabselect=Visits) category. These reports enable a client to review the various data captured during a visit or encounter. The Patient Observations report is available here, as well.
