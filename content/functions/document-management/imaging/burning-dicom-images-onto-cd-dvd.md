If you wish to burn the DICOM images onto a CD, log into {{% system-name %}} and get into the patient's chart.  Select the specific chart tab that stores the DICOM images being burned to a CD.

When you are on the appropriate chart tab, it will display the List View For Images. This lists all the DICOM images this patient has stored in {{% system-name %}} .  

In the Print column of each image line item, click BATCH on each image you want to burn.  Batching allows you to select as many images as you want and creates them in a batch to burn onto the CD.

Find another patient's images by going into another patient's chart tab and selecting their image(s) to batch using the same steps.

Continue selecting as many studies (images) as you need, for as many patients as you need.

If you make a mistake, click on the **Remove** link for that study

While you are batching DICOM images, you will notice at the very top a DICOM information summary **Print** and **Burn** link.  This shows and is tracking how many images/items you have batched for DICOM printing or burning.

When you have batched all the images and are ready to burn the images onto the disk, click on the **Burn** link at the top in that DICOM information summary.

The images you batched will appear in a new window.  When all of the images have appeared, click on the **Create Disk** button at the bottom (or close, to escape out and start over). Under the **Send To**, you can click on the [+] show or [-] hide viewing options for what you want to burn.

Click the **Next** button and wait for the process to complete (100%).  The disk should eject.

The disk can be read by any PC (computer), as the necessary software is actually included on the disk.

If the autorun option is not enabled for the PC (computer), then you can explore the disk, and double click on the **MeFilmLt.exe**, and follow the directions on the screen.
