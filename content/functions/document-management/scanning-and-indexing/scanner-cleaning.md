## Recommended Cleaning

Alcohol prep pads are used for all cleaning.

1. Open the scanner.
2. Clean the lenses (i.e., glass plates on the top and bottom of the inside of the scanner).
    a.  If there is a black line on the images, then scrub off the black specks of printer ink that accumulated on the lenses, as well as any other smudges on the glass plates. This residue creates the black line on images. Users may not see it; however, it is there, and it needs to come off, so be sure to scrub forcefully.
3. Clean the rollers.
4. Wait a couple of seconds for the alcohol to dry.
5. Close the scanner and continue scanning.
