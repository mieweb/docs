The Guided Template is a series of pop-up screens that take you through the step by step process of creating a schedule for the system.  It stores the same information as the legacy Schedule Add method, but in a step by step format.  The legacy Schedule Add editor is always available via the Add hyperlink in the Schedules screen.  For more detailed information see [Schedules Tab](schedules-tab.md) guide.
