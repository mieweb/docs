Log into {{% system-name %}}  
Click *Scheduler* from the left sidebar menu.  
If you have the preference in My Settings of FORCE DEFAULT RESOURCES set to Yes, your scheduler view will show all the resources (physicians) schedules that you have added an appt for or edited an appt for. To only show one resource, make sure this is set to No.
  
## Cancel/No-Show Appointments  
  
You can cancel/delete/edit or no show appointments from the Scheduler side menu tab or from the specific patient's appointments e-chart tab.
  
### Cancel Appointments from Chart  
  
Click *E-Chart* tab from left sidebar menu.  
Search and get into the file for the patient you need to cancel or no show an appointment for. When in their chart, click the *appointments* tab in the above chart tabs.  
It will list Waiting List, Pending, Past & Cancelled Appointments in separate sections/buckets for this patient on the screen.  
Click Edit on the appointment that you need to cancel or no show.

![](../cancel-no-show-edit-appointments.assets/4c5d1e35e6a41e72d84031edb4b6575a.png)  

It will open the appointment wizard screen. The patient's name should be in the top of this screen along with the appointment details for that patient's appointment.  
Scroll down towards the bottom of this Reschedule/Cancel Appt screen and there is a button *Cancel* under the comments section.

![](../cancel-no-show-edit-appointments.assets/da9c4a58e395edbf6a04106e82ea015d.png)  

1. You must go to the <em>Cancel</em> field and use the drop-down arrow to select a reason for why you are canceling the appointment or select NO SHOW if the patient was a no show.
2. Click the <em>SAVE</em> button to cancel or no show the appointment for the reason you selected. Your screen will refresh to the scheduler view you were on and remove that appointment from the schedule you are viewing.
3. It will automatically cancel or no show the appointment and put it into the <em>canceled</em> category or the <em>no show</em> category in the patient's appointment chart tab in their file.
4. To <em>reverse</em> (uncancel if you did it on accident), find the cancelled/no show appt (from the patient's appts listing or end of schedule views if preference is on) and edit it and change the cancel reason to the â€˜blank' selection (top selection). It will activate the appointment back for that date/time.
  
#### Enter New Cancellation Code  
  
If you have security role permission, you may see the *New Reason* selection from the drop-down choices. If you have security rights, you can add another cancel reason to the list if you don't find a cancel reason that is suitable for the reason you are canceling this appointment. Simply highlight and select *New Reason* from the drop-down.

* <strong>Cancellation Code</strong>: Just enter a brief abbreviation for this cancel reason. This does not show anywhere except the main Cancellation Code tab to manage codes.
* <strong>No Show:</strong> Check-mark this box if this reason is related and to be categorized as a No Show. Any patient with this reason used on their appointment will be in the category of <em>No shows</em> instead of <em>Cancelled</em> when looking at appointments.
* <strong>Reason</strong>: Type in the description of the cancellation. This is the description that <strong>will</strong> show up in the drop-down arrow choices for users to select from.
Click ADD CODE button when done and it will add your code to the list or click Close to get out of this mode.  
If you have security rights, you can manage/add/edit/delete existing cancellation codes from the *Cancellation Codes* top tab from within the Scheduler module.
