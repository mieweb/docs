Log into {{% system-name %}}

Click *Scheduler* from the left sidebar menu.

If you have the preference in My Settings of FORCE DEFAULT RESOURCES set to Yes, your scheduler view will show all the resources (physicians) schedules that you have added an appt for or edited an appt for. To only show one resource, make sure this is set to No.

4. To <em>reverse</em> (uncancel if you did it on accident), find the cancelled/no show appt (from the patient's appts listing or end of schedule views if preference is on) and edit it and change the cancel reason to the ‘blank' selection (top selection). It will activate the appointment back for that date/time.

#### Enter New Cancellation Code

If you have security role permission, you may see the *New Reason* selection from the drop-down choices.

Simply highlight and select *New Reason* from the drop-down.

* <strong>Cancellation Code</strong>: Just enter a brief abbreviation for this cancel reason. This does not show anywhere except the main Cancellation Code tab to manage codes.
* <strong>No Show:</strong> Check-mark this box if this reason is related and to be categorized as a No Show. Any patient with this reason used on their appointment will be in the category of <em>No shows</em> instead of <em>Cancelled</em> when looking at appointments.
* <strong>Reason</strong>: Type in the description of the cancellation. This is the description that <strong>will</strong> show up in the drop-down arrow choices for users to select from.

Click ADD CODE button when done and it will add your code to the list or click Close to get out of this mode.
