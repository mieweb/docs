Log into {{% system-name %}}

Click *Scheduler* from the left sidebar menu.

If you have the preference in My Settings of FORCE DEFAULT RESOURCES set to Yes, your scheduler view will show all the resources (physicians) schedules that you have added an appt for or edited an appt for. To only show one resource, make sure this is set to No.

This tab combines manual registration of a patient with the appointment/scheduler.

In this tab, it opens to the Patient Registration screen where you must first manually register a patient into {{% system-name %}} . Then it automatically proceeds and takes you to the Appointment Wizard tab to create an appointment for that patient.

If you have verified that the patient is **not** in {{% system-name %}} , then you can load them manually. If you enter a patient manually into your {{% system-name %}} system, this patient will appear in {{% system-name %}} only. It will not merge/appear in any other practice management system that your company uses (example: Medical Manager, Experior, Medic, etc.) or interfaces with.

Click *Scheduler* from left sidebar menu.

Click *Pat/Apt Wizard* tab from the top menu of tabs.

All this information populates the *Demographics* tab of the patient's chart.

Fill out the registration screen fields and click the **Save** button at the bottom.

For detailed information on each Patient Registration field, please see other help documentation titled *Patient Registration Tab-Manual Patient Entry.pdf*

It then goes to the *Appointment Wizard* screen for this new registered patient. It has also assigned an MR number (account number) for the patient you manually registered.

Manual Registration in {{% system-name %}} shows this new registered patient in {{% system-name %}} only. It will not merge/appear in any other practice management system that your company uses (example: Medical Manager, Experior, Medic, etc.)

Fill out the Appointment Wizard fields to create/add/save an appointment for the newly registered patient. For detailed descriptions on each field in the Appointment Wizard screen, please see other help documentation titled *Adding An Appointment Using Wizard Tab.pdf*

If you click the **Close** button in the Appointment Wizard screen without making an appointmentâ€”it will still save/keep the patient registration you just did manually and still puts that patient in {{% system-name %}} as a registered patient. You will see a message once the patient was added and you have the option to return to the scheduler if you didn't add an appointment through the wizard.
