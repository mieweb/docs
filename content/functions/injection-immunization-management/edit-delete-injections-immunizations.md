To make an edit or modify a specific immunization or injection record, get into the patient's injections tab to show the list of active immunizations/injections.  Find the specific injection or immunization that you wish to edit and click on the underlined injection/immunization name to get into the edit mode.

The injection record will appear.  You can change/edit any of the fields if you have security permission.  (example: the date of administering was wrong, the site was incorrect, etc.)

If you just wish to type in a comment (example: the patient had a reaction to this injection after it was given and recorded) and want to enter reaction measurements, then you can simply free-text type in the Comments/Reaction field or enter specific reaction measurements and other resulting documentation in the specific fields provided.  
Click Submit at the bottom of the screen to submit the edits you made to the injection record.  
It will now refresh back to the Injection List for the patient and you will see the complete injection records for the patient in their specific category. It has replaced the original record with the edits/modifications you made.  
It also gives a confirmation towards the top that says Successfully modified injection record.

When an edit is done, the Injection/Immunization listing also shows the initials of the user that modified it.

## **Delete an Injection/Immunization**

After clicking Delete, it will then ask you to confirm that you really want to delete this record.

Click Delete again to delete the injection record or cancel to get out.  
Another dialog screen will appear and will require you to type in the Reason for Deleting the Document (the Injection Record).  The injection record will appear below this message.

You must type in the reason for deleting this injection record.  It will not accept it if you do not type anything in this field.  
After typing in the reason for deleting the record, click Delete Document button below the reason field.
  
![](../edit-delete-injections-immunizations.assets/1000020100000640000001D420307864FB4B1A94.png)  

After you have typed in the reason for deletion and clicked Delete Document, it will say a confirmation message that Document (#) has been Deleted Successfully. And it will have the injection deletion record below that with the reason for deletion.

When you return to the patient's Injection List, you can view the deleted injection record(s) if the patient has any.  
To view the deleted immunizations or deleted other injections for the specific patient, then click [ Show Deleted ] and it will then show the active and deleted records for each category. Then click [ Hide Deleted ] there to show/view just the active injections and immunizations records for the patient.

To view why an injection record was deleted, you must click the Document Summary tab in the patient's chart and find the injection record (by doc.type name or Service Date, etc).  
Once you have found the deleted injection record in DocSum (will say Deleted in the DocID column) then click the underlined DocID for the corresponding deleted injection record.

  
![](../edit-delete-injections-immunizations.assets/10000201000006400000019614EB20B2D43E4131.png)  


After clicking the DocID number for the deleted injection record, that specific deleted record will appear in the screen and show the reason why it was deleted, when it was deleted, who deleted it, etc.
