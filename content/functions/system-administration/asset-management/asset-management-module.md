The Asset Management Module allows users to track equipment assigned to users, warranty information, maintenance request and calibration requirements. The module includes creating work orders, calibration requests and tracks these items over time. The module includes automation of notification 90 and 30 days prior to when calibration, service agreements, warranties and insurance policies are due or will expire. There is robust reporting included. Please verify with your MIE implementer that your system has been prepared to use the Asset Management Module. MIE Implementer must set up this module to be used in your  {{% system-name %}}  system and must have the two committed layout encounters & visit types enabled/activated on your system for use.

## Adding a Calibration Request  

Some equipment (assets) require calibration on a set time line such as annually. The Asset Management module will track completed calibration dates, automatically generate an email to the equipment owner/custodian at both 90 and 30 days prior to the due date, and create a work order type document for pending requests.
A Calibration encounter is available to create a work order style document to track calibration requests for each specific asset. There is also a report to track outstanding calibration requests and a detailed list of calibrations completed on each asset.
To add a Calibration request, you will be working in a Calibration Request encounter.
