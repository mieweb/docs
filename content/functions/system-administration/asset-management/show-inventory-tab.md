Show Inventory (Current Inventory) tab is located within the sidemenu tab named *Inventory*. It will open to the default (landing page) of showing you all current *General Inventory* for your system. It will show in and out of stock, but there is a hyperlink at the top right corner that you can hide or show Out of Stock. This is a listing of your current inventory in the system along with its quantity, where it is (site) and item details.

The columns show this information:
* <strong>Inv ID</strong>: This is the {{% system-name %}} inventory ID# the master inventory item was assigned.

* <strong>Item Name</strong>: This is the master inventory list item name of the inventoried item. This is also a hyperlink. If you click an item name shown here, it will take you to the <em>Transaction Report</em> screen and automatically limit that report screen to the inventoried item name you clicked. It prefills fields for you based on that item name you clicked.
* <strong>Qty</strong>: This is how many the site/location has on hand currently. Any Qty that is zero means it is out of stock. You can click the Hide Out of Stock link at the right to not show the inventoried meds that are out of stock.

### Show Patient Inventory  

If your practice utilizes the Patient Assistance Program and Patient Inventory medication functionality of the Inventory module, you can quickly see current inventory for Patient individual Inventory from this tab. This is accessed by clicking the Show Patient Inventory hyperlink at the right of this screen view. The Patient Assistance Inventory is used by practices that receive or buy meds for a specific patient through a patient assistance program sponsored by drug companies, etc.
  
![](../show-inventory-tab.assets/9513a3e9aeb0e770fb6baf210631a669.png)  

The Show Patient Inventory shows the medication inventory and the specific linked patients that have meds received through patient assistance programs specifically for them. These are entered by using the Dispense chart tab in the patient's specific chart (see other help documentation named *Add Patient Assistance Inventory*).
  
![](../show-inventory-tab.assets/4e4dc61c75547bdb3541708e31f0ff52.png)  

The options (Edit & Expire) are the same as above in the General Current Inventory screen (see instructions in previous pages).
There is however an option to Transfer to General. If you click Transfer to General, it will allow you to transfer a specific quantity of this specific patient's inventoried medicine into your practice's General Inventory (not patient specific).
  
![](../show-inventory-tab.assets/8d32d58a0faf5ac2d1ad3f79941b767c.png)  

When you click Transfer to General it defaults to show the quantity that specific patient currently has in their chart that is applied to them specifically. You then type in the quantity that you wish to transfer and designate the site. The patient field will display as NONE since it's being moved to "general" inventory and out of patient assistance inventory.
  
![](../show-inventory-tab.assets/49bc7c3f3abd917195f4b4ea005602bc.png)  

You should enter comments pertaining to the quantity & reason why you are transferring from the specific patient's inventory into the practice's general inventory.
