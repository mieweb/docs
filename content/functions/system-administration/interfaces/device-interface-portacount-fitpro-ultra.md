Before users can import FitPro Ultra test results into {{% system-name %}} they must first create an export file from the FitPro Ultra software. Once the file has been exported from the FitPro Ultra software and saved to the user's local computer, navigate to the FitPro Ultra Upload tool in {{% system-name %}}.

{{% note %}}
The FitPro Ultra Upload import tool is not currently available in the Device Import tab (Control Panel->Device Import Tool). The FitPro Ultra Upload tool must be manually installed by the {{% system-name %}} deployment team member.

Before selecting the file to import, enter the **Import** **Test Date Range**. The date range field is required and important, as the FitPro Ultra File export contains ALL fit tests ever performed on the FitPro device. Entering the **Import Test Date Range**, will limit the import to the dates specified in the **Import Test Date Range** field.

Once the **Import Test Date Range** has been entered, either select the **Choose Files** button to browse to your local drive to select the file to be imported, or drop and drag the file into the file upload box.

Once the file has been selected, the tests to be imported will display on the right side of the upload tool. If any tests need to be removed from the import, users may select the red and white X button to remove a test or click the **Clear List** button to remove all tests and start over. When all files to be uploaded display on the right side of the tool, select the **Upload Tests** button to import the documents.

Users will see a confirmation message in the upper right hand corner of the application confirming the file uploaded successfully. Each test that is uploaded will display in green and display a message that the upload was complete and display the document ID of the document that was imported.
