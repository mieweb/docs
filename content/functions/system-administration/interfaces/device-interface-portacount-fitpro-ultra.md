Before selecting the file to import, enter the **Test Dates** needing to be imported. This is important, as the FitPro Ultra File export contains ALL fit tests ever performed on the device. Entering the **Test Dates**, will limit the import to just the date(s) specified in the **Test Dates** field. If no dates are entered, all tests in the file will be imported.

Once the **Test Dates** have been entered, either select the **Choose Files** button to browse to your local drive to select the file to be imported, or drop and drag the file into the file upload box.

Once the girl has been selected, the tests to be imported will display on the right side of the upload tool. If any tests need to be removed from the import, users may select the red and white X button to remove a test or click the **Clear List** button to remove all tests and start over. When all files to be uploaded display on the right side of the tool, select the **Upload Tests** button to import the documents.

Users will see a confirmation message in the upper right hand corner of the application confirming the file uploaded successfully. Each test that is uploaded will display in green and display a message that the upload was complete and display the document ID of the document that was imported.
