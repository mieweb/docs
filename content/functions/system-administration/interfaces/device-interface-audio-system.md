The following is referring to an OMI Audiometric Data Management Software ASW2004 system. Contact your MIE Implementer to see if your audio system model can be interfaced or quoted.
  
## Audiogram  
  
{{% note %}}
First ensure that a calibration has been performed for the day. If one has not been performed you will receive this pop up box:

1. From the audiogram computer select OMI Audio Version 3 or if it has been renamed "Audio" shortcut from the desktop.
2. OMI Software will ask for user initials. Initials are not required to proceed

1. Once audiogram is complete choose Receive Audiogram in OMI.
   1. Verify that the correct patient is chosen.
   2. Select receive data (<strong>occasionally this box may need to be clicked a second time</strong>)
   3. You may receive a pop up regarding the ID used to perform the test and it will ask about adding zero's to the ID number. Select YES.
   4. The data will upload from the audiometer to OMI (See Example)

1. At the top of this box the folder is currently showing Audiometry 2003. This should be changed to "-LCC Audio Results" to navigate to the correct folder select the drop down arrow, select program files and then select "-LCC Audio Results". This is the folder where the results will be exported.

1. If you would like you can add the patients MR# ID to the filename by clicking in the File name box and renaming the file and select save. (Please note that the file extension must by .txt.) See below for example.

## Importing Audio Files  

1. Open {{% system-name %}} (if not already open) and choose correct patient.
2. Choose correct encounter and make sure there is an audiogram procedure on the due list or in office/tests procedures section; or you may need to add an encounter and check the due list for the audiogram procedure. If there is no audiogram procedure, you will need to add it to the due list.
  
![](../device-interface-audio-system.assets/10000201000002D1000000BB782791B4E5FF8A36.png)  

1. Or go to chart tab named Audio Tool and click add audiogram

![](../device-interface-audio-system.assets/10000201000002320000010BE8E7636DD4930E47.png)  

1. Choose reason for test and enter in any current test comments and/or overall comments. Even if the file you are importing has comments or overall comments, those will be imported there too.
2. Scroll down to the "filebox".
  
![](../device-interface-audio-system.assets/10000201000001BD000000D0C1DFF1ABE6EAB31B.png)  

Make sure the audiogram result files are showing up in the file box.

   1. Changing smartcard:
      1. Right click on "filebox"
      2. Choose set smartcard folder
  
![](../device-interface-audio-system.assets/10000000000000B600000104C4F84B3EB8F0AEB1.png)

![](../device-interface-audio-system.assets/100000000000013E000000C0BFC512F13D75942B.png)  

1. Audiogram files should populate the filebox
  
![](../device-interface-audio-system.assets/10000000000001B8000000C32CA263B0BAB64FF4.png)  

1. Choose the correct audiogram file for your patient.
2. Click the <em>upload file</em> button
   1. If you have no additional comments, Select ok on the first box stating no comment has been entered, upload anyway.
   2. Select <strong>YES</strong> on the second box asking if you want to delete as the folder should remain empty and only the current results should be showing. By deleting after each upload this will keep the folder clean and remove any confusion of selecting the incorrect file.
1. Audiogram results should populate in the Audio Tool.
2. You can answer the additional questions via that button also at any time and they will save when you save the encounter.
3. If working in an encounter, click the save button to save audiogram results to patients file.

You will see the audio file results in the encounter and also in the Audio chart tab of the patient's chart. You can view the document, use the
_
compare
_
feature, etc. On the document stored in the patient's chart, the MR# that populates within the file document that you uploaded looks at the user's default starting partition to determine which MR number to display there.
