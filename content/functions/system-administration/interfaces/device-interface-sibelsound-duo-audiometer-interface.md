Before users can import Sibelsound Duo Audiometer test results into {{% system-name %}} they must first create an export file from the Sibelsound Duo Screening Audiometer software. Once the file has been exported from the Sibelsound Duo Screening Audiometer software and saved to the user's local computer, navigate to the Sibelsound Duo Audio Upload Import tool in {{% system-name %}}.

{{% note %}}
The Sibelsound Duo Audio Upload import tool is not currently available in the Device Import tab (Control Panel->Device Import Tool). The Sibelsound Duo Audio Uplod import tool must be manually installed by the {{% system-name %}} deployment team member.

Once the file has been selected, the test(s) to be imported will display on the right side of the upload tool. If any test(s) need to be removed from the import, users may select the red and white X button to remove a test or click the **Clear List** button to remove all tests and start over. When all files to be uploaded display on the right side of the tool, select the **Upload Device File** button to import the test results.

Users will see a confirmation message in the upper right hand corner of the application confirming the file uploaded successfully. Uploaded files will display in green and display a message that the upload was complete, as well as display the document ID(s) of the document(s) that were imported. Click the numbered document link(s) to open the uploaded document(s) and view in a new browser tab.

*Note:* Users may notice that the uploaded document displays as Revision 1. This is intentional. Revision 0 is inserted by the import tool with the document type â€˜FAILDEVIMP', as a means to track and store text as attachments and troubleshooting. When the file upload is complete, the document will display all results as Revision 1.
