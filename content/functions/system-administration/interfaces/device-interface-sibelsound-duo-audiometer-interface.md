Before users can import Sibelsound Duo Audiometer test results into {{% system-name %}} they must first create an export file from the Sibelsound Duo Screening Audiometer software. Once the file has been exported from the Sibelsound Duo Screening Audiometer software and saved to the user's local computer, navigate to the Sibelsound Duo Audio Upload Import tool in {{% system-name %}}.

{{% note %}}
The Sibelsound Duo Audio Upload import tool is not currently available in the Device Import tab (Control Panel->Device Import Tool). The Sibelsound Duo Audio Uplod import tool must be manually installed by the {{% system-name %}} deployment team member.

_Note:_ Users may notice that the uploaded document displays as Revision 1. This is intentional. Revision 0 is inserted by the import tool with the document type ‘FAILDEVIMP', as a means to track and store text as attachments and troubleshooting. When the file upload is complete, the document will display all results as Revision 1.
