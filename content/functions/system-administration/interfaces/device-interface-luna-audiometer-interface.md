Before users can import Luna Audiometer test results into {{% system-name %}} they must first create an export file from the Luna Screening Audiomenter software. Once the file has been exported from the Luna Screening Audiomenter software and saved to the user's local computer, navigate to the Luna Audio Import tool in {{% system-name %}}.

{{% note %}}
The Luna Audio Import import tool is not currently available in the Device Import tab (Control Panel->Device Import Tool). The Luna Audio Import tool must be manually installed by the {{% system-name %}} deployment team member.

Once the file has been selected, the test(s) to be imported will display on the right side of the upload tool. If any test(s) need to be removed from the import, users may select the red and white X button to remove a test or click the **Clear List** button to remove all tests and start over. When all files to be uploaded display on the right side of the tool, select the **Upload Device File** button to import the test results.

Users will see a confirmation message in the upper right hand corner of the application confirming the file uploaded successfully. Each test that is uploaded will display in green and display a message that the upload was complete and display the document ID of the document that was imported.
