The following is referring to a Welch Allyn CardioPerfect EKG system. Contact your MIE Implementer to see if your EKG system model can be interfaced or quoted.  
Within {{% system-name %}} , you may have a chart tab named *EKG* where you can see the imported EKG device results and interpretations. Contact your MIE Implementer for set up.
