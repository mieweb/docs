## Max Records

Any active scheduled job with a specific number in the *Max Records* field of the scheduled job, will terminate the scheduled job once/if the max number of records is hit during that scheduled job.  The *Max Records* field sets a threshold for the number of records processed before requiring approval to continue to execute the scheduled job. The execution of the scheduled job is blocked when the max records count exceeds the row count the scheduled job finds to execute on. Set the Max Records field to zero 0 for no limit.

Using *Max Records* functionality may be helpful for email scheduled jobs.  Where a system admin wants to receive a warning and approve all scheduled jobs that will be triggered if the number of email recipients exceeds a specified threshold (X) max records.  This would ensure proper oversight of communications and prevent unauthorized or accidental dissemination of information.

### Max Records Exceeds Notification

The notification of the blocked scheduled job(s) being executed will be sent to the email address that is configured in the system setting *System / Cron / Email Failures To*.

![](../enabled-and-disabled-scheduled-jobs.assets/97a2a506c55890894ac7a46493061f6f.png)

### Max Records Exceeds Approval Process

The "approval" process refers to stopping the execution of scheduled jobs that exceed the configured max records value threshold.  The email notification is sent to the designated administrator (the email set in the system setting "Email Failures To") explaining that the job was stopped due to exceeding the allowed recipient count.

A system admin can then manually run the associated system report, review and decide whether to proceed with performing it (Perform All button). This manual execution serves as the approval step.  The other method is to simply remove the Max Records value from the scheduled job itself and manually execute the scheduled job to run, and after it has run entirely, the system admin can place back the Max Records value to take effect in the next run.

![](../enabled-and-disabled-scheduled-jobs.assets/017ed371f2938e1268b0f3b50904e21c.png)

## Status

* Green status circle means the scheduled job has run successfully routinely as the recurrence is set to.

* Grey status circle means the scheduled job has not run as of yet.
* Red status circle means the scheduled job has errored out during every run as the recurrence is set to.

![](../enabled-and-disabled-scheduled-jobs.assets/286a3ac2b49c16b9ebe9efa434d9bdb5.png)

### Status History

Clicking on a colored status circle for the specific scheduled job row, will display a Job History for the past 7 days of that scheduled job's runs.

The Job History lists the specific scheduled job name, and the date/time the scheduled job has run (according to recurrence it's set to), the total duration of how long the scheduled job took (in seconds) and another colored status circle within each listed run, to see which runs the scheduled job may have run successfully, or failed, etc.

## Revision History of Scheduled Job Configuration

Within the listing of scheduled jobs (whether active or inactive), is an option to view Revisions.

![](../enabled-and-disabled-scheduled-jobs.assets/d2fa8904a8ac537d2f182b3870ccacd6.png)

When looking at the Revisions of a scheduled job (in a pop-up window), each revision is listed with whom (user) made a change to the scheduled job, including a date/time stamp of that revision, and which field(s) were revised, and the field(s) revised show what the value or data was entered in by that user during the revision that was saved.  Revisions gives a chronological history of any revisions to the scheduled job that was selected to view.  Newest revisions would be at the bottom of the pop-up window and oldest revisions at the top.

![](../enabled-and-disabled-scheduled-jobs.assets/5f58ad399f24b0c4d15f6e5c6799dc2d.png)

**Recurrence Mapping**

When you set up a scheduled job, you pick a recurrence type (how often it repeats) and, depending on the type, a recurrence number (which days/months/etc. it runs).

A revision to the ‘recurrence' field of a scheduled job will display a value or calculation that may not be intuitive.  The revision value shows the raw numeric codes (e.g., 258, 32, 0 etc), and currently we are unable to convert these into clear descriptive text (e.g., specific months or weekdays).   Therefore, this is the mapping to decipher that revision's value when looking at revision history that may involve a Recurrence revision:

![](../enabled-and-disabled-scheduled-jobs.assets/a7f10060c0366d800ca2ba27a6b823e1.png)

**Recurrence Type**

* 0 = No Recurrence → Runs once at the start time.
* 1 = Minutely → Runs every 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, or 45 minutes.
* 2 = Hourly → Runs every 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 12 hours.
* 3 = Daily → Runs once every day at the chosen time.
* 4 = Weekly → Runs on the specific days of the week you select.

**Weekly Recurrence (Type 4)**

Each day of the week has its own number:

* Sunday = 1
* Monday = 2
* Tuesday = 4
* Wednesday = 8
* Thursday = 16
* Friday = 32
* Saturday = 64

If you check multiple days, the system adds them up:

All week (Sun–Sat) = 127  
Weekdays (Mon–Fri) = 62  
Weekends (Sat+Sun) = 65

**Example:** Mon + Wed + Fri = 2 + 8 + 32 = 42

* 5 = Monthly → Runs in the specific months you select.

**Monthly Recurrence (Type 5)**

Each month has its own number:

* January = 1
* February = 2
* March = 4
* April = 8
* May = 16
* June = 32
* July = 64
* August = 128
* September = 256
* October = 512
* November = 1024
* December = 2048

If you check multiple months, the system adds them up:

All months = 4095  
Q1 (Jan–Mar) = 7  
Even months only = 2730

**Example:** Feb + Sept = 2 + 256 = 258

* 6 = Yearly → Runs once a year on the chosen date.
