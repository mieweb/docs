## Audit Log Search

The Audit Log Search feature provides a powerful tool for meticulous examination of user activities within the system, ensuring transparency and accountability. To initiate the search, users must possess the requisite security permissions. Once granted access, users can pinpoint specific individuals and delve into their actions by navigating through the user interface. The Audit Log Search fields offer a versatile range of criteria, including patient names, document IDs, date ranges, IP addresses, event types, descriptions, and action permissions, facilitating precise investigation. The search results provide a detailed overview of the selected user's interactions, allowing users to further explore specific activities by utilizing links within the results. The Audit Log Search serves as a comprehensive resource for administrators and users alike to monitor, analyze, and respond to system events effectively.
