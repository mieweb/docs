System Administrators now have the ability to enable/disable a system lock that locks out system users and displays a system wide message informing the user that the system is currently undergoing maintenance. The feature is available to customers on version RC202403 and newer.

The system must have the System/Maintenance/Lock system setting enabled (disabled by default).

In conjunction with the system setting, the administrator must have the security setting to manage *System Maintenance* set to â€˜Yes' (default is set to No).

Once both the system setting and security setting are configured, the administrator may enable/disable the system maintenance lock out message from the System Maintenance portlet (Quick View). Click the Enable Maintenance Mode button to enable the lock out feature.

A Success message will display confirming that the system maintenance mode has been enabled.

End User Experience:  
If users are still viewing the System Maintenance page when the setting has been disabled, the user will be notified that the maintenance is complete and provided a button to refresh their browser and either login or return to their previous logged in session.
