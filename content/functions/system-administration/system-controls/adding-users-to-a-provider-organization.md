* <strong>First Name:</strong> {{% system-name %}} requires a First Name for every patient – to register your organization without a First Name, simply enter a "space" by using your spacebar on the keyboard. No Additional Demographic information is required, but you may fill in as much as desired. Scroll down to the bottom of the demographics screen and locate the Medical Records Section, and place a Checkmark in the box corresponding with the PO Partition

## Add Users to the PO Chart  
  
If you have just completed the registration process above, you should now be in the PO's Chart. If you have browsed away from the chart after registration, you will need to search from the E-Chart Tab.

## Adding POs to Users

Scroll to the lower portion of the screen and locate the Refresh with the User Patients ListEdit (which contains xx patients). This hyperlink and list does not get rendered at all if the setting "Webchart", "Settings", "Limit users to Provider Organization" is turned off. This is a feature mainly used by our Corporate Health practices. Clicking on the Refresh with the User Patients List link will query the system to render the list.
