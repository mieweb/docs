The *Encounter Types* module allows users to view system *Encounter Visit Types* and *Service Types*. *Encounter Visit Types* are typically used in clinical/ in-office workflows to capture data. *Service Types* are used on a limited basis for {{% system-name %}} utilizing custom hospital workflows only. The system comes preloaded with several preconfigured *Encounter Visit Types*. Service Types are typically custom and not preloaded. System Administrators can also add custom encounter and service types.

## Encounter Visit Types

The *Encounter Visit Types* datavis will display a list of all active visit types. Legacy or historical encounter types are hidden by default, but can be viewed by clicking the *Clear Filter* link on the *Encounter Visit Types* Datavis. Select the *Visit Types* link or the *Service Types* link located in the upper right hand corner to toggle between the two lists.
