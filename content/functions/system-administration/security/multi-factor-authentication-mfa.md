# Multi-Factor Authentication  

  
## Overview  
  
WebChart EHR Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is available in all systems (RC202009+) but is disabled by default.  Once MFA is enabled for a system, each user requiring MFA needs to be set up individually.
  
## Security Level  
  
WebChart EHR supports three levels of MFA.  The level of security can be selected on a per-user basis to meet your organization's needs.

* Only for Super-User functions (Least Security)
* When the system deems appropriate (More Security)
* At every login (Maximum Security)
  
## Password Type  
  
WebChart EHR supports two options for the second factor password:

* Time-based
* Counter-based  

MIE strongly recommends a time-based password; however, a counter-based password is an available option for those users that may have difficulty quickly typing a 6-digit number or have a device which does not reliably keep the current time.
  
## General Set Up  
  
Once MFA is enabled for a system, each user can be configured from their Edit User page.  Setup is completed most easily on a device that has 2D barcode scanning capability by following the prompts in WebChart and on your device; however, setup can also be completed with a device that does not support barcode scanning.
