The {{% system-name %}} system is HIPAA compliant and the role based access control security determines who can access the EHR system, and which features of the system the staff member may use. The {{% system-name %}} administrator can allow or limit staff access to patient information, lab results and {{% system-name %}} modification features. Security roles can be defined for an entire department such as physicians, reception, outside guests such as hospitals, or roles can be customized individually.  
Review user security settings for individual users or role based needing access to the various functionality, and give permission, as appropriate. The feature on how to compare security role based permissions is available in the[ ](https://docs.enterprisehealth.com/latest/documentation/components/system_admin/compare_security_roles.html)[Compare Security Roles](https://docs.enterprisehealth.com/latest/documentation/components/system_admin/compare_security_roles.html) online help.
  
## **Editing Security Settings**  

  
### **For All Users in a specific Security Role**  
  
Click Control Panel tab from left sidebar menu.  
Click Security Role Editor tab from top menu.  
Select the security role that you wish to change security settings for by clicking edit to the right of the department security role name.

  
![](../security-role-settings.assets/100002010000054C0000015BDF3BA42AC17FB978.png)  


At the top it will display which security role you are in for editing.  It also states the number of current users in this role. Click the view revision history for … to view revisions previously done to this security role.  This opens up a new window and you can search for revision details.  This is also the same link named Revisions that is provided in the prior listing of security roles options column.  
Change any security settings by using the drop-down arrow in the field(s).     
{{% note %}}

Security setting changes being made to the security role here, affect every user that is tied to the security role being edited.
{{% /note %}}

  
![](../security-role-settings.assets/1000020100000473000000B6F671B607D8570074.png)  


When finished changing any security settings for the entire role, scroll down to the bottom of this security role edit screen.  At the very bottom there is a text field where you are required to type in the reason for the security permission change(s).  You have to type something in here or it will not save your edits.  Then, click the Update Individual Security button below that.  It then saves these security settings for this individual user only.  These changes do not affect the entire security role, just this individual user.

  
![](../security-role-settings.assets/100002010000011D0000007F1965DD037B61A2B5.png)  


You will then get a confirmation message that you successfully edited/updated that entire security role.   You can select another security role department to change or continue to work in {{% system-name %}} .
  
### **For Individual Users**  

Individual users can be configured to have specific levels of security settings edited without affecting all users in an entire security role.  This would be for individuals who need permission or restricted from certain things, whereas the rest of the users in the same security role do not.  The user has the default security settings for their security role department, but editing security permissions for individual users allows you to select exceptions to some security fields just for this individual user only.
Select Control on left sidebar menu.
Select Access Control from the top tab menu.
Search for the specific user from Access Control using various search methods available.

  
![](../security-role-settings.assets/10000201000004C2000000FF0CCA0D39E718B927.png)  


Once the specific user has been located, click Edit on their user line at the far right.

  
![](../security-role-settings.assets/10000201000004C2000000FFCD79A05CADD1380F.png)  


After clicking Edit, the system takes you to the edit screen of their user details. Click Customize User Security hyperlink at the top right of the edit user screen.

  
![](../security-role-settings.assets/10000201000004B1000000B1A7AC62CF2D546B33.png)  


The Individual Security settings screen for that user will open. Select any security settings to change (for this specific user) by using the drop-downs in any security permission setting. When finished changing any security settings for the specific user, scroll down to the bottom of the individual security edit screen.  At the very bottom there is a text box field where you are required to type in the reason for the security permission change(s). You have to type something in here or it will not save your edits. Then, click the Update Individual Security button below that. System will then save these security settings for this individual user only.  The changes done here for individual user do not affect the entire security role, just this individual user.

## **Summary of Security Role Settings**  

  
### **WebChart**  

* Revoke PHI Access:  This permission controls access for a user to view or edit any tabs that display patient or personal health information (PHI), including E-chart, Appointments, Orders, and Documents. The following settings are available:
   * Yes: The user cannot view or edit tabs with PHI.
   * No: The user has access to view and edit tabs with PHI, and can access all patients based on their remaining user restrictions.
* Statistics: Allows users in a security role to access reports from the Reports Tab and System Reports.
* View Transcription Stats: In Control, in Statistics, Tran Reports. Yes to this setting allows users in a security role to view transcription statistics report.
* Limited to NMC area:  No or Yes if users should only be restricted to NoMoreClipboard area.
* Update Logo:  If user has permission, they can edit/upload/change the logo that appears in the top left corner of the practice's {{% system-name %}} system.  
* Asterisk Auto-Dial From: When viewing a user, if you have permission and system is set up, their work,home,cell will be links to call them. You must have a number on your user account or permission to specify a from number.  From MY NUMBERS or ANY NUMBER.
* Save Portlets:  'Own' allows user to set their own set of portlets on any facesheet type page or patient summary portets. 'Default' allows users to set defaults for security roles.
* Appliance Synchronization: Select Yes to enable appliance synchronization. Appliance synchronization allows a designated user to download patient data and other information (including configuration like reports, layouts, and settings) from a WebChart database from a primary server in order to transport and upload the data to a mobile server. This setting is often used for clients who operate clinics in remote, mobile facilities, such as cruise ships.
* Use Macros: Yes allows users to use dot.macros functionality through the magic wand icon.
* Macro Add/Edit: Yes allows users to access the macro dialog through the magic wand icon. This dialog allows creating, editing, searching, and enabling/disabling .macros system wide or to specific libraries.
* Manage Ledger: Yes allows user access to the Ledger and transactions.
* Manage Encounter Charges: This controls user access, view or to edit charges on an encounter. This is a specific charges section that is unique to ledgers, etc.
* Set Grid Defaults: Yes allows user to set default grid preferences for all other users in the system.
  
### **E-Chart**  

* Limited Access: This permission controls user access to specific patients. A user has access to a patient either through a direct relationship (such as provider to patient or supervisor to employee), or through the department they belong to (such as the nursing department to a patient). The following settings are available:
   * Yes: The user can access only the specific patients they have a direct relationship with. Relationships are defined in the setting Edit Patients Linked to User under Access Control > Edit User. If the Limited Access field is set to "Yes," it overrides the Restrict Access By Partition setting, and partition restrictions are ignored.
   * No: The user is not restricted to the relationships defined in Edit Patients Linked to User under Access Control > Edit User.
* Restrict Access by Partition:  Partitions are created in the Partition Manager to group information in {{% system-name %}} (patients, documents, etc.). Restricted partitions are hidden from certain users. This field determines whether or not a user can see patients in restricted partitions. The following settings are available:
   * Yes: The user can only access patients in unrestricted partitions or in restricted partitions to which their user or their department has access. Patients in hidden partitions do not display in search results and are not accessible. If the Limited Access field is set to "Yes," the Limited Access setting overrides the Restrict Access By Partition setting, so partition restrictions are ignored.
   * No: The user is not limited in the patients that they can see based on any partition restrictions.
* Allow Emergency Access to Charts: In emergency situations, a user may need access to patient information that is normally restricted. This field determines if a user can access a patient that they do not normally have access to for a limited time (the amount of time is configurable under System Settings). If either of the fields Limited Access or Restrict Access by Partition are set to "Yes," the Allow Emergency Access to Charts setting is used to search and access patients that are normally restricted to a user or department. Audit logs are stored for all patients accessed through this setting. Options:
   * Yes: The user can view a restricted chart for a limited time after confirming that access is required for each patient that is requested.
   * No: The user cannot access restricted patients.
* Limited to Default Tab:  This restricts users in a security role to only be able to view the tab/module that is set as the ‘selecting folder' in My Settings for each user.  A user will not be able to access any other tabs/modules.
* Patient Relationships: If set to View, users can only view patient relationships. If set to Edit, users can edit and end relationships. If set to Delete, users can do all the aforementioned and also delete patient relationships.
* Limited to Restricted Items: Setting to ‘No' allows the user to access everything unless they (or dept) are specified to be restricted from a specific doc.type, document, chart tab, or encounter type. This also applies to adding documents, and Print definitions now.That is the default. Setting to ‘Yes' limits the user from accessing no doc.types, documents, chart tabs, or encounter types.  They (or dept) must be specifically "allowed" to a doc.type, chart tab, or encounter type in order to see it. This setting allows a user to be marked ‘restricted' and only enable the certain things they should be able to see (doc.type, chart tab or encounter type, visit types).
* Limit DOB: Restricts the user from viewing a patient's DOB/Age Restricts in listviews and autocompletes, Document Queue, pocket mode, headers, etc.

   * View: Can view demo screen on patient's chart, but can't modify it.
   * Add: Can add/manually add a patient into the {{% system-name %}} system (if your system does not interface w/ {{% system-name %}} , or you manually add each patient)  Refers to patient registration. Can add only, not edit demo. info.
   * Edit: Can manually add/edit/change information on demo screen on a patient's chart. Can edit/add alerts, etc.
* Patient Insurance Policies:  This insurance screen shows on the patient demographics screen.
   * No Access: No access to the patient insurance. Nothing insurance related to the patient shows on the demo. screen at all.  Keeps insurance info private.

* Station Manager:  If set to Yes, users can access the Station Manager tab in Checkin. This gives the permission for these users to add, edit, & delete check-in stations.
* Chart Online: This is whether or not users in a role can mark a chart as online in {{% system-name %}} . This is how you can manually mark charts online full, partial or none with comments outside of the scanning software.
* Patient Merge inside Partition: Users can merge patients together inside of the partition that they are working in, such as MR or other partition that they are set to.
* Patient Merge outside Partition: Users can merge patients together over multiple partitions, but not inside the partition they are in (unless above option is marked).  This is crucial for some clients who have patients from multiple billing systems.
* Patient Merge All MR#'s: Users can merge patients anywhere in the {{% system-name %}} system.

* Document Lock: Allows users to lock a document so that no one can view the document or make changes to the document if they do not have permission to use the document lock system.
* Manage Document Records:  If another user is editing a document and you want to get into that document also at the same time, it will lock the document from your access since one user is already in it.  This permission allows the users in the role to remove those locks.
* Document Move: Allows users to ‘move' documents into another patient's E-chart. Example: if they were indexed to the wrong acct, etc.
* Document Delete: Allows users to ‘delete' documents from a patient's chart.  It will take document away, but will still show up as a deleted document in that patient's file/chart.

* View Preliminary Documents: If set to YES, the users have the permission to view all preliminary documents and can un-request any preliminary e-sign request.  If it is set to NO, then only the owner or the transcriber of the document is able to view the preliminary document and un-request the preliminary e-sign request.
* Author Documents: If set to No, this permission will restrict a user from being the authored by user on a document. The user will still have access to upload a document but the "Authored By" will be set to zero.
* Document Permissions:
   * No Access: No access/ no view to any type of document in a patient's chart.
   * View: Can view the documents in a patient's chart tabs only.  Cannot have access to add documents link or edit existing documents.

   * Edit: Can append or edit any and all documents in a chart regardless if the user was the creator (author) of the original document or not.
* Create Document Rights for All Patients: In the {{% system-name %}} environment, this will be set to None.  This setting is only used currently for NoMoreClipboard and isn't applicable to {{% system-name %}} at this time.  For NoMoreClipboard users, the security level this is set to allows the user to view, add, edit, or delete a document for ANY patient, regardless of if they technically have "rights" to the patient by other means we check.  It doesn't allow them to do anything else with documents or anything else on patients they don't have rights to, just being able to upload a document to any patient's chart.
* Restrict by Document Send:  If set to Yes, this permission restricts the users viewable documents to those that have been sent to them.
* Transcribe for others: A person can enter/add documents into the system for someone else such as a doctor, etc.   When creating a document, the AUTHORED BY: will allow you to choose the physician, etc for the document if this is set to YES.  If NO, your name will always be in the AUTHORED BY field and you cannot create/add documents for others as their name. Also, make sure this is set to YES if indexer or transcriptionist.  
* Sign Document: If set to Yes, this allows users within a security role the ability to sign documents.  You can sign ‘any' document in any patient's chart and also can sign documents from E-Sign tab.   If set to No, this limits users within a security role to only being able to sign their own documents sent to their specific username in the E-Sign tab. They can only sign their own E-sign requests.  The users would not be able to sign just any document in any patient's chart or for any other user's pending e-sign requests.
* Manage Doc Types:
   * None: No access to document types tab from a patient's E-Chart at all.
   * View: Can only view the document types from that tab. Cannot edit, add types or inactivate.
   * Add: Can view and add document types from that tab.  Cannot change/edit existing types or inactivate/delete types.

NO does not make this check-mark box available to users when they edit/add a doc. type.
* Manage Doc Type Purge Rules:  If set to Yes, users will see a link in the Document Types editor tab to ‘View Purge Rules'. From that link, users can view/edit/delete existing purge rules that are set up for documents or create new. If set to No, the user will not even see this link or have access.
* Allow Doc.Type Declaration:  If set to Yes, users can specify the doc.type abbreviation when creating or editing a doc.type to the system. If set to No, users cannot name a doc.type.  The system will automatically assign a doc.type number to the doc.type created.

They can also un-restrict Chart tabs that have been set to be Restricted Access. If this permission is set to No, the users will not be able to un-restrict chart tabs or edit (manage) any allowed users for a restricted tab. The restrictions option in the chart tab column will not be available to these users.
* Manage Print Defs: YES allows users full access to the Print Definition Editor tab. Meaning can view, edit, add, delete print definitions.  NO keeps a role from accessing this tab entirely.
* Manage Print Def Restrictions:  If set to NO, when creating or editing a print definition, the user is not allowed to restrict the print definition.  If set to Yes, the users can restrict a print definition and set the Allowed Users list for that print definition.
* Allow Print Def Declaration:  If set to Yes, users can name print definitions.  If set to No, users cannot name a print definition or edit the name.  The system will automatically assign the name as PD# to the print definition.
* Manage Encounter Types:  Yes allows users in the role full access to the Encounter Visit Types tab in the control tab.  Meaning users can view, edit, add, delete encounter visit types.  No keeps a role from accessing this tab entirely.
* Manage Encounter Exams:  Yes allows a role full access to the Enc Exam Editor tab in the control tab.  Users can access & change in the editor for encounter exams for the system (this is mainly for MIE use).  No keeps a role from accessing this tab entirely.
* Manage Observations:  Levels are No, View, Add, Edit, Delete.  Delete level gives a user full permission to edit, delete, add observations in a patient's chart.  No will not allow the user to access the patient's observations tab. These levels are related to the observations chart tab in a patient's chart. Anyone with encounter rights should also have rights to this setting.

* Allow Print Without Headers:  Choose Yes or No. Users with yes permission will be given the checkmark box in the Print mode whether they want to print/fax the document with a patient summary header at the top of the document or not. The No permission will make the printing/faxing of any document for that user always have the patient summary header at the top of the document.  They do not have an option.
* Document Queue: This queue is for documents that come from an outside source such as Parkview, that need to be manually linked to a patient in {{% system-name %}} .  Users can then look at the documents and send them to the correct patient if {{% system-name %}} could not figure it out (couldn't merge).
   * View: Can view the document queue tab to see what's out there that needs to be merged.  If have right set to view, the users will also see the # of Doc Queue documents pending & the link at the top left of the screen.

* Send by AutoRoute:  Select either No, Matching Only or All.
* Unlock Sending Routes:  This is mainly for MIE/Techsupport use and specific admins allowed to this function. In some cases of a coding error, routes can become ‘stuck' in the ‘In Progress' status as ‘sending' status. This security allows MIE/Tech support (intended audience) to retry these stuck routes without reverting to a backend tool. This feature allows the unlocking of any 'stuck' route which has been stuck for more than an hour.
* Chart Define Fax Number: Allows or denies access for users to setup fax numbers for faxing from {{% system-name %}} .
* RX Manager: Allows users in a security role to access levels of the Meds Tab for any patient.

   * View:  Can view the patient's conditions tab only;
   * Add: Can view and add patient & family conditions to the tab;
   * Edit: Can view/add/and edit/delete to the patient's conditions tab.
* E-sign Template Editor: This allows users within a security role to access the tab in E-Sign called Esign Editor.  This is the tab that shows the e-signs set up to request automatically and can add a template from here.  
* Storage Report Display:  Allows users in a role the ability to run the storage report or not.
* Simple Add: Allows users in a security role to access Simple Add module/procedure in the Meds tab for each patient.
* Prescribe: Allows users in a security role to access Prescribe module/procedure in the Meds tab for each patient.In Control category:
* Manage E-Rx Refills for Others:  Allows user to be able to see all pending e-refill requests in the e-refills queue pending for all prescribers.  They can then work those e-refill requests for the prescriber (ex: physician goes on vacation and allows another physician to work his incoming requests because all requests need to be worked within the mandated 48 hour timeframe from SureScripts).
* Drug Interaction Alerts:  Sets the severity of drug-drug interaction warnings shown to the user.
   * Show All: All severity levels of warnings will be shown;
   * Moderate: Moderate severity and higher warnings will be shown;
   * Severe: Only severe, contraindicated and higher warnings will be shown;
   * Hide All: No drug-drug interaction warnings will be shown.
* Dismiss Warnings:  This sets the level of permission for dismissing any warnings in the Meds tab program and other programs where warnings/alerts your system may be set up for.
   * No:  will not allow users in the security role to dismiss warnings at any level.
   * Yes: will allow users in the security role to dismiss warnings for your viewing only and for that patient only.
   * Dismiss for all Patients:  Usually only the Physician has security rights to dismiss at this level. The physician can dismiss the warning for that specific patient only or also has the option to dismiss the specific warning for all patients for the physician's view.   If the physician dismisses a warning for "all patients' they would only have to dismiss once and never see it generated again.  We discourage this because it really defeats the purpose of showing warnings and affects all other patients and the warning won't pop-up again for any patient.
   * Dismiss for All Users:  Usually only the Physician has security rights to dismiss at this level.  The physician can dismiss the warning for that specific patient or all patients and dismiss it from view for all users.  
* MIEWebScan:  Sets the level of permission of access to MIE WebScan program.
   * No Access: will not allow users in the security role to access MIE WebScan left sidebar menu tab program.

So, if you are in the physician role for a patient you can see things that the physician dept has access to. If you have rights you can click Access control and click edit on a specific dept, you will see viewable depts.  For instance, if you click edit on administrator you can then select what depts. the administrator users have access to.  So if you give a certain department access to the control module, you could select what depts. they have access to view. This is mainly for NMC use.
* Manage User Patients:  In order to be able to update the user patients table you need to have this role set to Yes. For now this affects the list edits for the user_patients table:  WCPATUSERSLE and WCUSERPATLE.  They both update the same table, but the first adds/deletes users to a patient and the other one adds/deletes patients to a user.

* Manage Custom Pharmacies:  Set as no unless your practice system has a special medication dispensing machine that can receive messages in the same format as those that we usually send thru SureScripts.  This dispensing machine sends the messages to a different URL than SureScripts so that it goes to the machine instead. There is a new editor for setting up a machine like this so that it looks like a regular pharmacy that can be e-sent to and set as a patient's preferred pharmacy. This security setting set to Yes would allow setting up those custom pharmacies for the dispensing machine.
* Allow .csv data import: Yes allows users access to the tab DATA IMPORT tab found in Control Panel sidemenu tab. If set to NO, users can't view this tab at all. YES security allows the user access to the tab and is able to download a .csv template file to import data and fill in patient demographic data using a spreadsheet application.

You would need to contact MIE Implementer if the practice needed their system to be multilingual (when MIE releases this feature-currently still in beta testing) and then this security setting would be applicable. User can see translate bubbles also if this is on for the user.
* Allow connections to foreign systems interfaces: This security setting allows a user to access Web Services (or other types of interfaces) that MIE has built into {{% system-name %}} .  There is a new module called wc_connector. The connector works by posting or browsing to a URI in {{% system-name %}} .  {{% system-name %}} will then talk to the foreign systems through their interface. Therefore, we specifically have to give certain user accounts access to it, because not everyone will need to or should be able to access the web services (or other type of interface).   
* Add Help Text: In Beta testing still—contact MIE first. If that setting is set to yes, the user will see the page context and the normal help question mark that when clicked will create a popup for them to enter the help text.
