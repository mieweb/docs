The Provider Management features allows users with the proper security to add New Providers and Provider Organizations within {{% system-name %}}. Provider Organizations are typically a location or an entity, where a Provider is typically an individual.

{{% system-name %}} also has the ability to help build a hierarchy of relationships between providers and provider organizations. For example, Internist Butler MD is a provider associated with Better Corp, which is a Business Entity/Provider Organization. Another example, Ashish Patel MD is a provider that works at EHS Office Clinic, which is a clinic location/Provider Organization. Creating a hierarchy between Provider and Provider Organizations is not required by {{% system-name %}}, but it can be helpful or necessary based on specific client requirements.

The Provider Management tab is located under the Control Panel side menu.

## Provider/Provider Organization Search

Enter the name of the provider or provider organization in the **Name** field and click the **Search** button. Check the box to the right of the **Name** field if the search should include deactivated providers/provider organizations. The **Name** field search provides a "contains" search and does not require an exact match to the data entered. Users may also click the *Provider Management* datavis header bar and a list of all providers/provider organizations will render in alphabetical order or click the **All Providers** link on the far right of the Provider Management module to view all providers/provider organizations.

The list of providers/provider organizations display in a datavis. Simply click on the Provider or Provider organization name on the result to enter the provider/provider organization "chart". The provider/provider organization "chart" captures specific data related to that provider/provider organization, such as address, license information, etc.

## Direct Trust Directory

For {{% system-name %}} systems that have Direct Messaging configured, a DirectTrust Directory will display in a datavis format under the Provider Management datavis. Clients not set up with Direct Messaging will not see a Direct Trust Directory in their system.
