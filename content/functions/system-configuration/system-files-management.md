## Managing System Files  
  
The System Files manager displays the currently uploaded system files. There are several columns of the layout, which point to various details of the files. By clicking the **Manage System Files** link while revising or removing files, this overview layout can be accessed at any time. From the table, a preview or link to the file is made available, along with the upload time, revisioning history, edit date, storage type, and file alias for easy identification. The **Edit** and **Delete** links provide quick access to modification options and removal, as well. From this same page, there is an **Add System File** link available in the upper-right corner, which provides a means to upload additional system files, if necessary.
