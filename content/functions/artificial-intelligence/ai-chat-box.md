### Report Generation

AI has been incorporated into the system report writing. AI generates SQL-based reports from natural language queries. The AI assistant context includes common subjects within the application, such as patients, observations, allergies, medications and procedures. This feature is available in RC202403 and newer.

*Hint:* Add a new report, then initiate AI to assist in writing the report. Being in the correct module helps AI understand in what context to form a response. Watch an example [HERE](https://youtube.be/UFH5FwgzL0k).

### What will AI Know?

The What will AI Know? link displays at the bottom of the AI Assistant chat box. Clicking the link will direct the users to the Root Context information screen. The Root Context screen outlines the database tables utilized in the AI response. The example below demonstrates context used when editing/writing a system report. When this feature is used in a patient chart, context will show information like the patient's name, dob, medications, allergies, history, etc.
