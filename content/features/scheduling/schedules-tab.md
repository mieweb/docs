Clinicians and schedulers are able to book appointments accurately and efficiently by using built-in schedule templates within the system for resources (providers).  Maintaining and utilizing schedules also helps reduce override errors when scheduling appointments.  Resource schedules can be easily maintained in the system from the **Scheduler** sidemenu tab via the **Schedules** tab. Adding, editing, and deleting schedules is a simple process, which also allows for copying or templating for fast and efficient onboarding. Additionally, scheduling resources can be limited, or restricted, if necessary, to assist with efficiency and security purposes.

The **Schedules** tab (if you have security permission to view) will display Active Schedules and Past Schedules. Deleted schedules are removed from the system and not obtainable.

## Security Permissions

In order to view Schedules from the Scheduler sidemenu tab, you must have security permission to **View Schedules**.  To add or edit schedules to the system, you must have permission to **Edit Schedules**.

![](./schedules-tab.assets/56bfb510091b41f9c285fbebaf496513.png)

## Add a Schedule

To add a new schedule to the system (with proper security permission), click the **Add** hyperlink at the top right to add a schedule.

![](./schedules-tab.assets/db24bd5434007015dbc182c0ec826c4a.png)

For more detailed information on how to add a schedule to the system, please see [Schedule Management](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YLVMv1dXMH2AzPJuyh6cMCVXhZvgGazUbjNePCMCTKY).

### Guided Schedules

There is a My Settings Preference to be able to utilize **Guided Schedules** when adding schedules to the system.

![](./schedules-tab.assets/dd86ee5f0a57cb048dde4a5b249b8182.png)

Enabling the Guided Schedules preference will allow a **Guided Template****** hyperlink to display for use in the Schedules screen.  Using the** Guided Template** method (to add a schedule to the system) will walk the user through the inputs to successfully add a schedule to the system, instead of just using the Add screen that shows all inputs at once.

![](./schedules-tab.assets/c2f85b50c535a69ab5a62228401fee4f.png)

For more detailed information on how to utilize Guided Template to add a schedule to the system, please see [Scheduler Guided Template](scheduler-guided-template.md).

## Save Info and Use Again

A schedule (being configured in the system or an existing schedule) can be saved as a template to be used in the future as a starting point for future new schedules to build. It's essentially the way to ‘copy' a schedule so you can retrieve the template later in the future and do a few edits to it to add another similar schedule without having to re-key all the fields that are the same.

The schedule templates saved can only be accessed via the **Add** or **Edit** method on a schedule, not the guided template method.

![](./schedules-tab.assets/9323c3699583f3623bf5168b19f5ab69.png)

If you **Save info to use again** on the schedule information that was or is being entered, you will be able to retrieve it and make slight modifications to it in order to create another scheduler similar to one you've already done. This is like a ‘copy' feature where you save & copy the schedule template you created so you can retrieve it and make slight modifications to it for another schedule you wish to create—without having to re-key all the fields again.

![](./schedules-tab.assets/8f8143c3a3056729f18a5e06c33e5521.png)

### Save Template

When you click the **Save info to use again**, it pops open a **_Save Template_** window. Name the scheduler template so you can use it again if need be to create another schedule again just like it (perhaps for another location or another resource) so you don't then have to re-key in the fields that would remain the same entry data you already did for a schedule. When you are done naming the saved schedule template and have check-marked or uncheck-marked specific fields to save with this template, click the SAVE button at the top or bottom of the *save template* window. You are **not** saving the schedule you are accessing or adding currently, you are simply saving the ‘template' of this schedule so you can use the basic template again for another schedule you wish to add.

![](./schedules-tab.assets/85e1601de966ca8b372f88c8846e6b2b.png)

When you are done saving the template, make sure to click the **SAVE** button at the end of the schedule you just created (or edited) in the schedule editor module so that the schedule is saved & created (or edited) in the system.

## Show Previously Saved Info

To retrieve any previous saved schedule templates, click the **Show previously saved info** link found at the top of the schedule being accessed or added.

![](./schedules-tab.assets/37cbd8ee88903863aaf0328fb370e7de.png)

It will pop open the **_Saved Templates_** window showing you a list of **Personal** and **Global** templates that were saved (using the steps above) and their names given. If you wish to utilize and select a *saved template* to start a schedule configuration, click on an available template name in the listing.

![](./schedules-tab.assets/7e577f2e0e74c3bc2719cd410b2f116f.png)

The template will open up in a window and you can check mark which entry fields you wish to bring into your schedule you want to create. Once you have each field/category check-marked, click the APPLY button found at the top or bottom of this screen.

![](./schedules-tab.assets/546d01aa3d480e622d6e3a2345a4e8b0.png)

You will then be refreshed back to the Schedule Editor configuration screen with all the fields/categories pre-populated with the template you selected and can edit and modify to create this new schedule to what you need, then click the **SAVE** button.

### Manage Saved Templates Security Permission

There are security permission levels for **Manage Saved Templates** that interoperate with the Schedule Templates that can be saved and accessed to use to help configure new schedules with.

![](./schedules-tab.assets/8ff72844dfab7476ff907e1771634261.png)

Depending on your security level to **manage saved templates**, you may see a delete option to be able to delete your own saved templates or global/other users templates for managing purposes.

## Edit a Schedule

To edit an existing schedule in the system (with proper security permission), click the **Edit** hyperlink in the options column of an existing schedule.

![](./schedules-tab.assets/7f672f73e9511c473b8311282bf92c32.png)

For more detailed information on how to edit a schedule in the system, please see [Schedule Management](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YLVMv1dXMH2AzPJuyh6cMCVXhZvgGazUbjNePCMCTKY).

## Delete a Schedule

A schedule can be deleted from the system entirely from use.  Deleted schedules cannot be reactivated, they are permanently deleted.

![](./schedules-tab.assets/a0b6ea2cf3679d9bb18f718754550065.png)

A message will display to confirm you want to delete the schedule.  Deleting a schedule cannot be brought back.  It will be deleted from the system for use.

![](./schedules-tab.assets/c89d137769d7be4b484f2a7356f86758.png)

NOTE: If there are existing appointments scheduled within the system that are for the resource, location etc within the schedule that you are wanting to delete, it will alert you the number of appointments that exist using that schedule you want to delete.  You would likely want to move those existing appointments before deleting the schedule from the system.

![](./schedules-tab.assets/c80420d076aa816155c7cd806c705afb.png)

A message that it *successfully deleted schedule* will display and the schedule has been removed from the system.

![](./schedules-tab.assets/12541c791bb1b1eebdbe6981ed0c38f1.png)

For more detailed information on deleting a schedule in the system and/or moving existing appointments off the schedule that needs to be deleted, please see [Schedule Management](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YLVMv1dXMH2AzPJuyh6cMCVXhZvgGazUbjNePCMCTKY).

## Past Schedules

Any schedules that are past its end date & time will appear in the Past Schedules datavis section of the Schedules tab.  Past Schedules are not deleted schedules. They are schedules that have been ended with an end date.
![](./schedules-tab.assets/29a994db596ad3af7ec9a971c39a4945.png)

An end date is within the recurrence section.  If it is past any specific recurrence date indicated there, it will then be a ‘past schedule' according to the system, but still accessible for viewing or editing to reactivate, etc.  NOTE: Blank ‘recurrence until' schedules will remain active and never expire.

Some users may wish to type in an end date in the recurrence to inactivate the schedule, instead of entirely deleting a schedule.

![](./schedules-tab.assets/4795fdbf550afeee067948dbcfaeb844.png)

## Schedule Revisions

Schedules offer visibility to any revisions.  This added visibility helps users quickly identify schedule changes, understand what was modified, and keep scheduling accurate and accountable. Simply click the **Revisions** hyperlink in the options column.

![](./schedules-tab.assets/514e483ea73f1627fef0c2e2d3bcf2ce.png)

Accessing revisions of a schedule will display the details of the original schedule configured and by whom and when.  Below that will be any history of additional revisions to the original schedule, including details and by whom and when.
