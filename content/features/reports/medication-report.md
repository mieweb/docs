You must have security role access to the Reports module/tab. This setting is in the Security Role Editor and is in {{% system-name %}} controls called STATISTICS. Set to Yes or No. This allows users within a role to access the entire Reports tab.

## Meds Report

Click *Reports* tab on the sidemenu.

Find the *Medications/Allergies/Scripts* tab from the top tab menu and select the *Meds Report.*

You do not have to fill out every single field. These fields are different ways to report stats and each field gets more specific and narrows your search down.

This is a report you can run to get result different statuses of medications tied to a patient.
