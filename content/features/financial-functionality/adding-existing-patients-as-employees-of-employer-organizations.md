Typically, employee charts are created and related to employer organizations automatically based on information from HR (human resources) systems. However, existing employee charts can be related to an EO chart manually.

[Find the employer organization](finding-employer-organizations.md) chart and get into the EO chart, to which to relate an employee chart to.

Select the **Admin (EO/PO)** tab. A menu appears. From the menu, select **Employees**.

The system displays a list of employees currently related to the employer organization.

At the right of the **Employees** section, click the **+** icon to add a relationship to the employer org chart.

The **Add Relationships** pop-up window displays.

Use the auto-complete to find an employee chart to relate to the employer organization chart you are working in.  You can search and relate multiple employee charts (to this organization chart) at a time within this pop-up window.  Click SAVE button when done.

If you cannot find an existing employee chart to link to the EO chart, you can utilize the Add New Employee button within the same pop-up instead.

This will allow you to manually register a new employee chart to the system, which will then relate it to this EO chart.
