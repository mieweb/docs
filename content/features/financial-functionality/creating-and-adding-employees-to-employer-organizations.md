Typically, employee charts are created and related to employer organizations automatically based on information from human resources systems. However, an employee chart can also be registered manually to the system and related to the EO chart you are working in.

When creating and adding employee charts to employer organizations, an employee's basic information is entered within the employer organization. Then, the system creates a new patient/employee chart for the employee and the process is completed from the patient demographics screen.

[Find the employer organization](finding-employer-organizations.md) chart and get into the EO chart, to which to relate an employee chart to.

Select the **Admin (EO/PO)** tab. A menu appears. From the menu, select **Employees**.

The system displays a list of employees currently related to the employer organization.

At the right of the **Employees** section, click the **+** icon to add a relationship to the employer org chart.

If you cannot find an existing employee chart to link to the EO chart (using the provided auto-complete field), you can utilize the Add New Employee button within the same pop-up.

After keying in the demographic information (required is Last Name, First Name & Birth Date), click the ADD NEW button.  That will register the chart to the system, will relate the employee chart to the EO chart.

The user is redirected to the *Demographics* tab of the newly registered/created employee chart. The chart displays demographics and the organization associated with the employee. Users can return to the Employer Organization by clicking on the employer name in the dark grey patient header.
