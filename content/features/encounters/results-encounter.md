## Results Encounter

The Results encounter is used whenever an order is sent out to be performed by an outside facility (via an Order Request), and the results are received back at the practice. Users can complete the Order Request and document the results of the order electronically, capturing the results discretely by way of the Results encounter. Review the default sections of the Results encounter, and be sure all sections needed to meet any prescribed workflows or business needs are considered.

## Results Encounter - Due List

When a user selects Perform Order or the Lightning Bolt icon from the Due List, a Results encounter is automatically created/opened. Either click on the Lightning Bolt icon

Or select the order and click the Perform Orders button.

## Working a Results Encounter

### Case Section

A case is a full report of a workplace injury, or incident, for an employee (patient). The case is created in an initial visit (encounter), and is then linked to subsequent visits. A case links all follow up visits (encounters), restrictions, accommodations, conditions, and nature of injury information. All of the documents pertaining to the case are grouped together within the chart for reporting purposes. There are several case types, which designate different required fields as well as state specific incident questions and forms. The terms case and incident may be used interchangeably in a system.

A user can link the Results encounter to a previously opened case by clicking the plus icon on the Quick List or create a new case by opening the Case section by clicking the gray Case bar.

For additional information regarding the Case section, refer to the [Case Management](https://docs.enterprisehealth.com/functions/injury-care/case-management/) documentation.

### Linked Documents Section

The system allows any stored or indexed document to be linked to a corresponding encounter whether the encounter is open or closed. Linking a document to an encounter in a chart allows users to easily view the encounter and corresponding linked documents, all from one place. Security permission of *Link Documents to Encounters* must be permitted to users that need to link documents to encounters.

To link a document to the encounter, click on the Documents tab and scroll to the document you wish to link to the encounter.

![](./results-encounter.assets/0cd9a1a23020d04f4763a733302f6018.png)

Hover over Options from the document you wish to link to the encounter and click the Link icon.

Click the Results button from the gray bar to return to the Results encounter.

To learn more about Linking Documents to an Encounter, refer to the [Link Documents to Encounters](https://docs.enterprisehealth.com/functions/document-management/documents-and-forms/link-documents-to-encounters/) documentation.

### Tests & Procedures Section

The Tests & Procedures encounter section can be found in the Objective section. This section mimics the stand alone "Due List" chart tab. The Tests & Procedures section displays items that are "due" so when a patient comes in, and the staff is working in an encounter, the clinician has visibility of items that the patient is due for, here in this encounter section.

To add any of the Due List items to the Results encounter, click on the Lightning Bolt icon when you hover over the item.

![](./results-encounter.assets/224b95937ee9204554b56f6fdb2fcbbe.png)

To learn more about the Test & Procedures section, refer to the [Test & Procedures - Applying/Adding, Completing, Resulting](https://docs.enterprisehealth.com/functions/encounters/tests-and-procedures-section-applying-adding-completing-resulting/) documentation.

### Due List Item - In Progress Order

Under the Test & Procedures section, the order that was selected from the Due List, will display. The order will be In Progress. To complete and key in a result to a procedure or test item within the encounter, simply click the specific procedure's gray title bar in the encounter section.

### Recommendation Section

A Recommendation aka: written opinion is done by a provider who can make a determination as to the employee's status and determine whether the employee is fit to perform his/her duties.

The Recommendation section displays only RE order types (recommendation/written opinion) action item associated with the employee's panel (its representative event). Note: RE order types (recommendations) are not able to be added or applied in the encounter tests/procedures encounter section. Only RE order types (recommendations) can be added or applied in the Recommendations section of an encounter.

To add the Recommendation to the Results encounter, hover over the order and click the Lightning Bolt icon.

## Removing/Hiding Sections - Tools Icon

In a Results encounter, you can "hide" a section and it will keep it hidden for that encounter if you have security permission to *Remove Encounter Sections* set to *Any* or *Any except locked*. A section can be defined as "locked" in the outline layout.

![](./results-encounter.assets/8bc107e2b79dfbd0eafb4cd77f1c057a.png)

The X icon at the right side of each section is the "hide section" functionality.

![](./results-encounter.assets/5292a8efb01eb6272eb8ce976da235f8.png)

I can bring that section "back" to be shown on the encounter I'm working in if needed to. Simply go to the top and find and click the *Tools* icon. It will popup a window named *Tools*. It lists any hidden items at the top. All you have to do is click on the specific name of the section you want to populate back in.

![](./results-encounter.assets/effa5c94ac8962209fcbf29fcddc6c1f.png)

Once I clicked on the word "Financials" from that pop-up window, the Financials section immediately inserted back into the proper position in my encounter. It also immediately removed that in the list of my Tools *hidden items* section since it's now not hidden anymore and is back populating in the encounter.

![](./results-encounter.assets/d59c1dd07a18a3737b5d1aacf100e6fa.png)

You can close the *Tools* pop-up window by clicking the X in the top right corner.
