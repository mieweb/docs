A department represents a functional area of an organization.  Users are linked to departments to determine what type of role(s) they do, what workflows they participate in, and which data, tasks, and actions are available to them in the system.

## Viewing Departments

A list of configured departments can be viewed by clicking on the *Control Panel* sidemenu tab and then within the *Access Control* tab at the top.  It will display an alphabetical list of the department names that exist in your {{% system-name %}} system.

Each listed department name is a hyperlink.  One can click on the underlined *Department* name to open a detailed list of the users that are linked to any department.

## Add a Department

When needing to add a department name to the system configuration, click the Add Department hyperlink at the top right of the department listing screen within Access Control.

When you click Add Department, the Add Department screen fields will display.

**Name**: Enter the full name of the department you wish to add to the system.

**Description:** Can enter in a description for this new department, but the contents do not show anywhere.

**Viewable Departments**: Then you must check any *Viewable Departments* that you want this department to be able to view. Make sure its own department is check-marked. Once the department is checked, the users in that department will be able to view anything that those other users in that department(s) are allowed to view.

**Check All Depts:** You can check-mark *all* of the departments by clicking the** **_Check All Dept_** button. These viewable departments are primarily if a user is set to a security permission to view restricted departments only. For example, suppose I am an administrator (as my primary department) and my viewable departments are physicians and nurses, but not pharmacists. Then I cannot see anyone whose primary department is "pharmacists". If the physicians department can view nurses, pharmacists and administrators, then a person whose primary department is "physicians" can view any pharmacist. If, as a primary administrator, I am also in the physicians department, I still cannot view anyone in the pharmacy department. If a dept is marked viewable, the user can see the other users within that department. *Currently this is for NoMoreClipboard use only, however any system user may be set to be restricted to view specific department(s) only.*

**Users in New Department:** Utilize the auto-complete to link any existing user(s) to this new department.

To save your work, simply click the **SUBMIT DEPT** button.  The system will display a blue successful message having added the department to the system configuration.

* <strong>Revisions:</strong> Revision history is available to view and applies to the department name only.  Meaning, revision history tracks any changes to the department name itself and when a department is created or marked deleted.

* <strong>Edit:</strong> Allows editing a department name and/or managing users tied to the specific department.

![](./managing-departments.assets/b2805cd5e7149dc354e280f3e2b90a15.png)

* <strong>Delete:</strong> When clicking the <em>delete</em> option, the system will ask you to confirm if you would actually like to delete the department.
    * NOTE: There may be existing users linked to the department you are wanting to delete.  Deleting a department, does <strong>not</strong> remove existing users from being linked/tied to that department.

    * Departments don't actually permanently delete.  They get marked as ‘inactive' in the system.
    * To view <em>inactive</em> departments, simply click the Show Inactive hyperlink available in the Departments listing header.

![](./managing-departments.assets/a32a25686e70ed4a7e0097e9fad8ebc2.png)

    * All departments will list and introduce an ‘active' column where you can visibilly see if the department listed is active or not.
        * An inactive department can be activated back for use.

If you need a department completely and permanently deleted, you can submit a request to your MIE/Deployment Contact.
