The data will interface in. If you want to see the raw data coming in, you can click the *show/hide raw data* hyperlink. When data is done, click the **Submit** button to save the data to the patient's chart/encounter document.

If doing the Cholestech as an in-house testing procedure, you may see other layout fields on your screen that the data will populate after you connect to the device. Once the data is populated from the device, you would click "completed" for the in-office procedure order and continue on in the encounter or save work.
