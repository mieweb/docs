The {{% system-name %}} system includes an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) encounter to document cases for an individual/dependent or an organized event. Cases are organized on a worklist by follow-up date, with detailed EAP reports available. EAP staff document case notes in a secure partition. Access is limited to authorized users and is not accessible by the Health and Medical staff. 
Functionality includes:
* EAP Individual Encounter
* EAP Organizational Encounter
* EAP Worklist
* EAP Reports
Custom configuration of email templates and automated notifications, data collection customization, or custom reports by MIE is available as an add-on service.
