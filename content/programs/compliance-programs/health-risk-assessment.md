A Health Surveillance Panel, Questionnaire, Task, Encounter and Reporting have been created for an Annual Health Risk Assessment/Biometric Screening and can be used to track employee health. The standard workflow can be customized to fit any organization's specific needs.

## Health Risk Assessment Panel

To ensure yearly compliance, an Annual Health Risk Assessment Panel has been created. This panel consists of the Health Risk Assessment Questionnaire. When an employee is enrolled in the panel, the questionnaire is added to their due list and a waitlist appointment is created. The timeframe for completion can be updated to fit the business needs.

## Health Risk Assessment Questionnaire

Once the employee is enrolled in the panel, the Health Risk Assessment - Biometric Screening Questionnaire will be available for them to complete on the portal. Click the "begin" button to complete the questionnaire.
