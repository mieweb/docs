The absence management module tracks absence requests, intermittent time off, eligibility and approvals, and coordinates communication among all involved parties. The employee portal allows the employee to print any necessary paperwork. Standard email templates are pre-loaded to send to the employee and/or their supervisor, manually.

Functionality includes:

* Capability to print standard leave forms from the patient portal
* Pre-loaded standard email templates
* Absence Management encounter
* Quick View Absence Management Worklist
* Leave Types Report

Custom configuration of automated email notifications, encounter customization, leave forms, or custom reports by MIE is available as an add-on service.
