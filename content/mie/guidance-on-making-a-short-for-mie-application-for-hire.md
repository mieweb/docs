## Guidance for Your YouTube Short Application: The Cult of Done

At MIE, we embrace the "Cult of Done." We value action, authenticity, and getting things across the finish line. Your YouTube Short is not about perfection—it's about showing us who you are, what you've accomplished, and why you want to join our team.  Also, don't tell us, show us.

## What to Include in Your Short:

* <strong>Introduce Yourself:  
    </strong>Who are you? Where are you from? What makes you, you?  <strong>YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE ON CAMERA</strong> - see [Working backwards at MIE](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zxa0Rgq56xGHOgY51DbZJVUlWMRh2pbd6AupVYI9IZc#heading=h.jxbqsmje5bfb) so you can show us, don't tell us.
* <strong>Your Passions:  
    </strong>What excites you about your work? What are you passionate about?
* <strong>Your Career Story:  
    </strong>Walk us through your professional journey. For each major role, share your key accomplishments and, most importantly, why you made each transition. What drove you to move from one place to another?  Show us things you are proud about building or accomplishing.
* <strong>Why MIE?  
    </strong>What attracted you to our team? After checking out [MIEweb.com](https://mieweb.com/?utm_source=bluehive&utm_medium=chat&utm_campaign=bluehive-ai), [EnterpriseHealth.com](https://enterprisehealth.com/?utm_source=bluehive&utm_medium=chat&utm_campaign=bluehive-ai), or [BlueHive.com](https://bluehive.com/?utm_source=bluehive&utm_medium=chat&utm_campaign=bluehive-ai), what stood out to you?
* <strong>Embracing AI:  
    </strong>We encourage curiosity and openness to new technology. If you've used AI or are interested in it, let us know!
* <strong>Keep it Under Three Minutes:  
    </strong>Focus on what matters most. Don't worry about editing, lighting, or production value. Story is king.

## [The Cult of Done Manifesto](https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13):

* There are three states of being: Not knowing, action, and completion.
* Accept that everything is a draft. It helps to get it done.
* There is no editing stage.
* <strong>Laugh at perfection</strong>. It's boring and keeps you from being done.
* Banish procrastination. If you wait more than a week to get an idea done, abandon it.
* The point of being done is not to finish but to get other things done.
* Once you're done, you can throw it away.

**Be yourself. Get it done. Show us who you are.**
